            "Seasonality is a characteristic of a time series in which the data experiences regular and predictable changes which recur every calendar year .",
            "Any predictable change or pattern in a time series that recurs or repeats over a one - year period can be said to be seasonal .",
            "In such situations , the forecasting procedure calculates the seasonal index of the `` season '' -- seven seasons , one for each day -- which is the ratio of the average demand of that season ( which is calculated by Moving Average or Exponential Smoothing using historical data corresponding only to that season ) to the average demand across all seasons ."

        "answer": "Seasonality, in which data experiences regular and predictable changes which recur every calendar year, is the method of forecasting, where averages are used to calculate the seasonal index of the season."
