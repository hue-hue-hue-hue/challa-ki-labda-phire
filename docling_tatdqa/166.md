## Note on Alternative Performance Measures (APMs)

The APMs adopted by the Group are defined on pages 190 and 191. The APMs which relate to adjusted income statement lines are presented and reconciled to GAAP measures using a columnar approach on the face of the income statement and can be identified by the prefix "adjusted" in the commentary. All APMs are clearly identified as such, with explanatory footnotes to the tables of financial information provided, and reconciled to reported GAAP measures in the Financial review or Notes to the consolidated financial statements.

The performance of the Group is assessed using a variety of performance measures, including APMs which are presented to provide users with additional financial information that is regularly reviewed by management. These APMs are not defined under IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with similarly identified measures used by other companies.
