## Stock-Based Compensation Expense and Valuations of Stock Awards

We estimated the fair values of our restricted stock-based awards that are solely subject to service-based vesting requirements based upon their market values as of the grant dates, discounted for the present values of expected dividends.

The fair values of our PSUs were also measured based upon their market values as of their respective grant dates, discounted for the present values of expected dividends. The vesting conditions and related terms of our PSUs were communicated to each participating employee as of their respective grant dates and included attainment metrics that were defined, fixed and based upon consistent U.S. GAAP metrics or internal metrics that are defined, fixed and consistently determined, and that require the employee to render service. Therefore, these awards met the performance-based award classification criteria as defined within ASC 718.

May 31, 2019

We estimated the fair values of our stock options that were solely subject to service-based vesting requirements using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, which was developed for use in estimating the fair values of stock options. Option valuati on models, including the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, require the input of assumptions, including stock price volatility. Changes in the input assumptions can affect the fair value estimates and ultimately how much we recognize as stock-based compensation expense. The fair values of our stock options were estimated at the grant dates or at the acquisition dates for options assumed in a business combination. The weighted-average input assumptions used and resulting fair values of our service-ba sed stock options were as follows for fiscal 201 9 , 201 8 and 201 7 :

$^{ }$The expected life input is based on historical exercise patterns and post-vesting termination behavior, the risk-free interest rate input is based on U.S. Treasury instruments, the annualized dividend yield input is based on the per share dividend declared by the Board, and the volatility input is calculated based on the implied volatility of our publicly traded options.

We estimated the fair values of the PSOs granted during fiscal 2018 at approximately $10 per share using a Monte Carlo simulation approach as of the grant date with the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 2.14%, expected term of seven years, expected volatility of 22.44% and dividend yield of 1.49%.

Stock-based compensation expense is included in the following operating expense line items in our consolidated statements of operations:
