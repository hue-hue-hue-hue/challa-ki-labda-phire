As a result of the adoption of ASC 606, our deferred product revenues and deferred product costs for the fleet management and auto vehicle finance verticals increased as balances are now amortized over the estimated average in-service lives of these devices. Deferred income tax assets and accumulated deficit increased as a result of the changes made to our deferred product revenues and deferred product costs. The cumulative effect of the changes made to our consolidated balance sheet for the adoption of ASC 606 were as follows (in thousands):
