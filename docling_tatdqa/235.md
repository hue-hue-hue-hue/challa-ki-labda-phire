## Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company's Board of Directors adopted the 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"), which became effective in March 2014, pursuant to which 1,200,000 shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance. In addition, ESPP provides for annual increases in the number of shares available for issuance on the first day of each year equal to the least of (i) 0.5% of the outstanding shares of common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding year, (ii) 400,000 shares or (iii) such other amount as may be determined by the Board of Directors. Eligible employees can enroll and elect to contribute up to 15% of their base compensation through payroll withholdings in each offering period, subject to certain limitations. Each offering period is six months in duration. The purchase price of the stock is the lower of 85% of the fair market value on (a) the first day of the offering period or (b) the purchase date.

The fair value of the option feature is estimated using the Black-Scholes model for the period presented based on the following assumptions:
