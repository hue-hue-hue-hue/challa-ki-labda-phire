## Cash and Cash Equivalents

Highly liquid instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are invested with high credit quality financial institutions and consist of short-term investments, such as demand deposit accounts, money market accounts, money market funds and time deposits. The carrying amounts of these instruments reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate their fair value because of their immediate or short-term maturities.

Cash and cash equivalents are unrestricted and include the following (in millions):

| Trade receivables, net          | $ 175.1        | $ 172.3        |

In addition to the amounts above, we have unbilled receivables that we do not expect to collect within the next year included in Other non-current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Billings for these receivables are based on contractual terms. Refer to Note 11 Other Non-Current Assets.

The allowance for doubtful accounts represents management's estimate of uncollectible balances. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience and other currently available evidence. We write off trade receivables when the likelihood of collection of a trade receivable balance is considered remote.

The rollforward of allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows (in millions):
