The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $4,970 million and $2,191 million at fiscal year end 2019 and 2018, respectively, related principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss, capital loss, and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. During fiscal 2019, tax loss and carryforwards increased primarily as a result of a $2,891 million (tax effected) net write-down of investments in subsidiaries in certain jurisdictions,
