The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company's accrued interest and penalties were approximately $18.9 million and $20.4 million as of August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company recognized interest and penalties of approximately $(1.5) million, $(6.7) million and $5.2 million during the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

It is reasonably possible that the August 31, 2019 unrecognized tax benefits could decrease during the next 12 months by $5.8 million, primarily related to a state settlement.
