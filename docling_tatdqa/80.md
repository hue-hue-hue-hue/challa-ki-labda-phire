Equity securities included approximately $15 million of BCE common shares, or 0.06% of total plan assets, at December 31, 2019 and approximately $8 million of BCE common shares, or 0.03% of total plan assets, at December 31, 2018.

Debt securities included approximately $53 million of Bell Canada debentures, or 0.21% of total plan assets, at December 31, 2019 and approximately $68 million of Bell Canada debentures, or 0.30% of total plan assets, at December 31, 2018.

Alternative investments included an investment in MLSE of $135 million, or 0.53% of total plan assets, at December 31, 2019 and $135 million, or 0.59% of total plan assets, at December 31, 2018.

The Bell Canada pension plan has an investment arrangement which hedges part of its exposure to potential increases in longevity, which covers approximately $4 billion of post-employment benefit obligations.

The fair value of the arrangement is included within other alternative investments. As a hedging arrangement of the pension plan, the transaction requires no cash contributions from BCE.

## CASH FLOWS

We are responsible for adequately funding our DB pension plans. We make contributions to them based on various actuarial cost methods that are permitted by pension regulatory authorities. Contributions reflect actuarial assumptions about future investment returns, salary projections and future service benefits. Changes in these factors could cause actual future contributions to differ from our current estimates and could require us to increase contributions to our post-employment benefit plans in the future, which could have a negative effect on our liquidity and financial performance.

We contribute to the DC pension plans as employees provide service.

The following table shows the amounts we contributed to the DB and DC pension plans and the payments made to beneficiaries under OPEB plans.

We expect to contribute approximately $170 million to our DB pension plans in 2020, subject to actuarial valuations being completed. We expect to contribute approximately $120 million to the DC pension plans and to pay approximately $75 million to beneficiaries under OPEB plans in 2020.
