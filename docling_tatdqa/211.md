The NSH Australian group also has gross tax losses of $4,325,818 (2018: $5,467,450) for which a deferred tax asset has not been recognised, as the future utilisation of these losses is more uncertain.

The Group's approach to financial risk management is discussed in note 15. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period is the carrying amount of each class of financial asset mentioned above.

All derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges. They are presented as current assets or liabilities if they are expected to be settled within 12 months after the end of the reporting period. The derivatives above relate to interest rate swaps and forward currency exchange contracts held by the Group, for further details see note 9.5.

## Classification as trade and other receivables

Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for rental income, goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. Loans and other receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. If collection is expected in one year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.

87

The allowance for expected credit losses represents an estimate of receivables that are not considered to be recoverable. For the year ended 30 June 2019 the Group has recognised an expected loss provision following the adoption of AASB 9 Financial Instruments . The Group recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime expected credit losses at each reporting date. The Group assesses this allowance based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors. At 30 June 2018, the Group recognised a provision for trade receivables relating to receivables acquired on the purchase of investment properties where there are specific risks around recoverability.

See below for the movements in the allowance for expected credit losses in the Group.

See note 17 for terms and conditions relating to related party receivables.

|                                                    | 2019  $'000   | 2018  $'000   |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|

| Charge for the year                                | 165           | -             |
| Recognised on acquisition of investment properties | -             | 79            |
| Utilised                                           | (53)          | (98)          |
| At 30 June                                         | 135           | 23            |

The age of trade receivables not impaired was as follows:

|               | 2019  $'000   | 2018  $'000   |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| 0 to 3 months | 3,534         | 2,590         |
| 3 to 6 months | 82            | 312           |
| Over 6 months | 19            | 129           |
|               | 3,635         | 3,031         |

The carrying amounts of current receivables are assumed to be the same as their fair values, due to their short-term nature. The fair value of non-current receivables approximates carrying value.

## 9.3. Other assets

|                                | 2019  $'000   | 2018  $'000   |

## 9.4. Trade and other payables

|                                  | 2019  $'000   | 2018  $'000   |
|----------------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Current                          |               |               |
| Trade payables                   | 3,486         | 4,184         |
| Accrued expenses                 | 6,706         | 2,717         |
| GST and employment taxes payable | 2,644         | 1,256         |
| Other payables                   | 6,157         | 4,161         |
| Total                            | 18,993        | 12,318        |

Trade payables are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition. Other payables and accruals are paid when amounts fall due. The carrying amounts of trade and other payables are assumed to be the same as their fair values, due to their short-term nature.

## 9.5 . Borrowings
