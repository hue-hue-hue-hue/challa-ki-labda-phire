## Stock Options with Time-based Vesting Criteria

In November 2017, we granted 10,924 incentive stock options and 69,076 non-qualified stock options with a total grant date fair value of$17.55 per share, o r $1.4 million. These stock options were valued using a Black-Scholes model, using a volatility rate of45.7%, a risk-free rate of 2.21%, a strike price of $36.61 and an expected term of 6.5 years. Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period which approximated 4.5 years for these awards. These awards were included in the cancellation during the fiscal first quarter of2019 as discussed in the section below.

## Stock Options with Market-based Vesting Criteria

We grant NQs that are subject to vesting only upon the market price of our underlying public stock closing above a certain price target withinseven years of the date of grant. Share-based compensation expense is recognized regardless of the number of awards that are earned based on the market condition and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated service period of approximately three years. If the required service period is not met for these options, then the share-based compensation expense would be reversed. In the event that our common stock achieves the target price per share based on a 30-day trailing average prior to the end of the estimated service period, any remaining unamortized compensation cost will be recognized.

Stock options with market-based vesting criteria granted for fiscal years2019, 2018 and 2017 were 585,000, 325,000 and 320,000, respectively, at weighted average grant date fair values of $7.47, $15.52 and $13.18 per share, or total grant date fair value $2.4 million, $5.0 million and $4.3 million, respectively.
