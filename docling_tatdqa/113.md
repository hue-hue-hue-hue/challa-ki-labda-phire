## Distribution Network and Channels

We distribute film content primarily through the following distribution channels:

- x theatrical , which includes multiplex chains and stand-alone theaters;
- x television syndication , which includes satellite television broadcasting, cable television and terrestrial television; and
- x digital and ancillary , which primarily includes IPTV, VOD, music, inflight entertainment, home video, internet channels and Eros Now.

We generally monetize each new film we release through an initial 12-month revenue cycle commencing after the film's theatrical release date. Thereafter, the film becomes part of our film library where we seek to continue to monetize the content through various platforms. The diagram below illustrates a typical distribution timeline through the first 12 months following theatrical release of one of our films.
