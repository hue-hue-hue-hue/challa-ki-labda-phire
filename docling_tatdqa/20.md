At each reporting date, we weigh all available positive and negative evidence to assess whether it is more-likely-than-not that the Company's deferred tax assets, including deferred tax assets associated with accumulated loss carryforwards and tax credits in the various jurisdictions in which it operates, will be realized. As of December 31, 2019, and 2018, we recorded deferred tax assets related to certain U.S. state and non-U.S. income tax loss carryforwards of $4,724 and $4,647, respectively, and U.S. and nonU.S. tax credits of $15,964 and $16,909, respectively. The deferred tax assets expire in various years primarily between 2021 and 2039.

Generally, we assess if it is more-likely-than-not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized during the available carry-forward periods. As a result, we have determined that valuation allowances of $8,011 and $8,274 should be provided for certain deferred tax assets at December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the valuation allowances relate to certain U.S. state and non-U.S. loss carry-forwards and certain U.S. state tax credits that management does not anticipate will be utilized.

No valuation allowance was recorded in 2019 against the U.S. federal foreign tax credit carryforwards of $5,785, which expire in varying amounts between 2023 and 2029 as well as the research and development tax credits of $7,495, which expire in varying amounts between 2021 and 2039. We assessed the anticipated realization of those tax credits utilizing future taxable income projections. Based on those projections, management believes it is more-likely-than-not that we will realize the benefits of these credit carryforwards.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act") was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. We recognized a provisional amount of $18,001 as an additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017. This amount included $11,734 related to the mandatory deemed one-time transition tax and $6,267 related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities.

On December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118") was issued to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. The remeasurement period for SAB 118 ended on December 22, 2018, and upon completion of our analysis we determined the final impact of the Tax Act resulted in an additional tax benefit of $348 during the fourth quarter of 2018. This amount included a $589 tax benefit related to the onetime transition tax and $241 tax expense related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities.
