The Company has multiple distinct contracts with AT&T spread across multiple lines of businesses, which expire at varying dates between 2020 and 2022. The Company has historically renewed most of these contracts. However, there is no assurance that these contracts will be renewed, or if renewed, will be on terms as favorable as the existing contracts. Each line of business is governed by separate business terms, conditions and metrics. Each line of business also has a separate decision maker such that a loss of one line of business would not necessarily impact the Company's relationship with the client and decision makers on other lines of business. The loss of (or the failure to retain a significant amount of business with) any of the Company's key clients, including AT&T, could have a material adverse effect on its performance. Many of the Company's contracts contain penalty provisions for failure to meet minimum service levels and are cancelable by the client at any time or on short notice. Also, clients may

unilaterally reduce their use of the Company's services under the contracts without penalty.

Total revenues by segment from the Company's largest client other than AT&T, which was in the financial services

vertical in each of the years, were as follows (in thousands):
