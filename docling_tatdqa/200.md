Interest income increased $1.2 million primarily as a result of higher weighted-average balances of cash, cash equivalents and investments and higher yields on investments.

Interest expense increased $5.3 million primarily as a result of interest expense of $3.3 million associated with our long-term debt and our financing lease obligation of $2.0 million in connection with the construction of our Lexington, MA - U.S. headquarters.

Foreign exchange expense and other, net decreased by $3.1 million primarily as a result of a decrease in foreign exchange expense of $1.9 million, sublease income of $0.9 million and a gain on a previously held asset related to the Solebit acquisition of $0.3 million.

Provision for income taxes decreased $0.7 million in the year ended March 31, 2019 compared to the year ended March 31, 2018, which is primarily attributable to the tax benefit provided on the loss of our Israeli entity, and the tax benefit for the release of a portion of pre-existing U.S. and U.K. valuation allowances as a result of the Ataata and Simply Migrate business combinations, partially offset by an increase in income tax provision due to the earnings of our South African entity.

Revenue increased $75.3 million in the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the year ended March 31, 2017. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to increases in new customers, including approximately 4,000 new customers added since March 31, 2017, a full year of revenue related to new customers added during fiscal 2017 and additional revenue from customers that existed as of March 31, 2017. Revenue for the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the year ended March 31, 2017 was positively impacted by approximately $4.7 million primarily as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the South African rand and to a lesser extent the British pound.
