MaxLinear also assumed certain of Exar's stock-based awards in the merger. MaxLinear paid aggregate cash consideration of $688.1 million including $12.7 million of cash paid to settle certain stock-based awards that were not assumed by MaxLinear in the merger. The Company funded the transaction with cash from the balance sheet of the combined companies, including $235.8 million of cash from Exar, and the net proceeds of approximately $416.8 million from $425.0 million of new transaction debt (Note 8).

## 5. Goodwill and Intangible Assets

## Goodwill

Goodwill arises from the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets and other identifiable intangible assets acquired. The fair values of net tangible assets and intangible assets acquired are based upon preliminary valuations and the Company's estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period (potentially up to one year from the acquisition date).
