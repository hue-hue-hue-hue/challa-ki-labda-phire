|                                                                       | (in millions)   | (in millions)     | (in millions)     |

| Net cash used in financing activities                                 | (709)           | (707)             | (429)             |

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $224 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to more favorable timing of working capital changes including higher advance payments from customers, $59 million received for the Greek arbitration award and lower payments for integration and restructuring costs. These activities were partially offset by higher tax payments, the timing of interest payments and $60 million of proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps in the prior year.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $242 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to lower payments for taxes, integration and restructuring costs and proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps. This was partially offset by $24 million of cash paid related to the 2016 acquisition of Lockheed Martin's Information Systems & Global Solutions business ("IS&GS Business").

Net cash provided by investing activities increased $179 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to $178 million of proceeds received for the dispositions of our commercial cybersecurity and health staff augmentation businesses, $96 million of proceeds received for the sale of real estate properties and $81 million of cash paid in the prior year related to our 2016 acquisition. These activities were partially offset by $94 million of cash paid related to the acquisition of IMX, higher purchases of property, equipment and software and lower proceeds from promissory notes.

Net cash used in investing activities increased $43 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to $81 million of cash paid related to the 2016 acquisition of the IS&GS Business, partially offset by $40 million of proceeds from the settlement of a promissory note.

Net cash used in financing activities increased $2 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to the timing of debt payments and higher stock repurchases, partially offset by $23 million of cash paid related to a tax indemnification in the prior year and the timing of issuances of stock.

Net cash used in financing activities increased $278 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to $250 million of stock repurchases under the ASR program, $167 million of open market stock repurchases and $23 million of cash paid related to a tax indemnification liability. This was partially offset by $150 million of lower debt payments and $14 million of proceeds received from a real estate financing transaction.

## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have outstanding performance guarantees and cross-indemnity agreements in connection with certain aspects of our business. We also have letters of credit outstanding principally related to performance guarantees on contracts and surety bonds outstanding principally related to performance and subcontractor payment bonds as described in "Note 26-Commitments" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These arrangements have not had, and management does not believe it is likely that they will in the future have, a material effect on our liquidity, capital resources, operations or financial condition.
