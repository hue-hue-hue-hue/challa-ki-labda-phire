The 46% decrease in new product revenue in 2019 was primarily due to lower sales from Display Bridge Solution, eFPGA license and connectivity product, which was partially offset by an increase in AI SaaS revenue. The increase in mature product revenue was due primarily to increased orders from our customers in the defense, aerospace, test and instrumentation sectors.
