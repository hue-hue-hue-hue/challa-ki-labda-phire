Unrealized gains and losses on VMware's available-for-sale securities are reclassified to investment income on the consolidated statements of income in the period that such gains and losses are realized.

The effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments is reclassified to its related operating expense line item on the consolidated statements of income in the same period that the underlying expenses are incurred. The amounts recorded to their related operating expense functional line items on the consolidated statements of income were not significant to the individual functional line items during the periods presented.

## R. Segment Information

VMware operates in one reportable operating segment, thus all required financial segment information is included in the consolidated financial statements. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. VMware's chief operating decision maker allocates resources and assesses performance based upon discrete financial information at the consolidated level.

Revenue by geographic area is based on the ship-to addresses of VMware's customers. No individual country other than the U.S. accounted for 10% or more of revenue during the years ended January 31, 2020, February 1, 2019 and February 2, 2018.

Long-lived assets by geographic area, which primarily include property and equipment, net, as of the periods presented were as follows (table in millions):

| Total         | $ 1,069            | $ 962              |

No individual country other than the U.S. accounted for 10% or more of these assets as of January 31, 2020 and February 1, 2019.

VMware's product and service solutions are organized into three main product groups:

- · Software-Defined Data Center
- · Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Computing
- · Digital Workspace-End-User Computing

VMware develops and markets product and service offerings within each of these three product groups. Additionally, synergies are leveraged across these three product areas. VMware's products and service solutions from each of its product groups may also be bundled as part of an enterprise agreement arrangement or packaged together and sold as a suite. Accordingly, it is not practicable to determine revenue by each of the three product groups described above.
