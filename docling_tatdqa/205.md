The purchase has been accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3. The fair value of net assets acquired was assessed and no material adjustments from book value were made to existing assets and liabilities. The period in which measurement adjustments could be made has now closed on this acquisition and the final goodwill calculation is summarised below:

|                                                     | Fair value £m   |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|

| Customer relationships                              | 3.2             |
| Non-compete agreement                               | 0.6             |
| Website                                             | 0.4             |
| Deferred tax liability arising on intangible assets | (0.7)           |
| Intangible assets and related deferred tax          | 3.5             |
| Current assets                                      |                 |
| Trade and other receivables                         | 0.7             |
| Cash and cash equivalents                           | 0.3             |
| Current assets                                      | 1.0             |
| Current liabilities                                 | (0.8)           |
| Total net assets acquired                           | 3.7             |
| Goodwill on acquisition                             | 8.5             |
| Total assets acquired                               | 12.2            |
| Cash consideration                                  | 12.2            |

The goodwill recognised on acquisition relates to value arising from intangible assets that are not separately identifiable under IFRS 3. This represents synergies expected to arise from combining with the existing business of Auto Trader Limited. None of the acquired intangible assets or goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

In addition to the goodwill recognised, the customer relationships, non-compete agreement and website obtained through the acquisition met the requirements to be separately identifiable under IFRS 3.
