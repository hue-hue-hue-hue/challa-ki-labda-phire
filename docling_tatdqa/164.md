Accounts receivable, net, remained stable to $60.3 million at December 31, 2018. The movement of the year was primarily due to (i) a $2.5 million increase in accounts receivable of Navios Logistics; and (ii) $2.6 million accounts receivable, net of Navios Containers. The overall increase was mitigated by (i) a $3.7 million decrease in accounts receivable from charterers and other receivables in Dry Bulk Vessel Operations; and (ii) a $1.4 million decrease in accrued voyage income in Dry Bulk Vessel Operations.

Amounts due from/(to) affiliate companies, including current and non-current portion, decreased by $9.9 million from $82.7 million payable for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $74.5 million payable for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was due to (i) a $7.7 million increase in balances relating to Navios Europe I and Navios Europe II; and (ii) a $1.7 million net decrease in payable of management and administrative fees, drydocking and other expenses prepaid by the affiliates according to our management agreements; partially mitigated by a $1.2 million increase in balances following the transfer to Navios Partners, the Company's rights to the Navios Revolving Loans I and Navios Term Loans I (as defined herein).

Inventories decreased by $2.5 million, from $30.2 million at December 31, 2017 to $27.7 million at December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a $3.7 million decrease in inventories of Navios Logistics mainly attributable to a decrease in inventories in the liquid port in Paraguay; partially mitigated by (i) a $0.6 million increase in inventories on board of our dry bulk vessels; and (ii) $0.6 million inventories of Navios Containers.
