return appropriate for each category of assets weighted for the distribution within the diversified investment fund. The assumptions used for the plans are based upon customary rates and practices for the location of the plans. Factors such as asse t class allocations, long-term rates of return (actual and expected), and results of periodic asset liability modeling studies ar e considered when constructing the long-term rate of return assumption for our defined benefit pension plans.

Weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the plans at the end of each period were as follows:

|                               | Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   | Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   | Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   |

| Discount rate                 | 2.0%                            | 1.8%                            | 1.7%                            |
| Rate of compensation increase | 2.7%                            | 2.6%                            | 2.6%                            |

In selecting the appropriate discount rate for the plans, the Company uses country-specific information, adjusted to reflect the duration of the particular plan . The discount rate was based on highly rated long-term bond indexes and yield curves that match the duration of the plan's benefit obligations.

## Defined Contribution Plans

Autodesk also provides defined contribution plans in certain foreign countries where required by statute. Autodesk's funding policy for foreign defined contribution plans is consistent with the local requirements in each country. Autodesk's contributions to these plans were $29.6 million in fiscal 2019, $27.2 million in fiscal 2018, and $26.6 million in fiscal 2017.

## Cash Balance Plans

Autodesk provides a cash balance plan that insures the risks of disability, death, and longevity, in which the vested pension capital is reinvested and provides a 100% capital and interest guarantee. The weighted-average guaranteed interest crediting rate for cash balance plans was 1.0%, 1.0%, and 1.3% for mandatory retirement savings and 0.3%, 0.3%, and 0.8% for supplementary retirement savings for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

## Other Plans

In addition, Autodesk offers a non-qualified deferred compensation plan to certain key employees whereby they may defer a portion (or all) of their annual compensation until retirement or a different date specified by the employee in accorda nce with terms of the plan. See Note 7, "Deferred Compensation," for further discussion.

## 16. Restructuring and other exit costs, net

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Board of Directors approved a world-wide restructuring plan ("Fiscal 2018 Plan") to support the Company's strategic priorities of completing the subscription transition, digitizing the Company, an d re-imagining manufacturing, construction, and production. Through the restructuring, Autodesk seeks to reduce its investments in areas not aligned with its strategic priorities, including in areas related to research and development and go-to-market activities. At the same time, Autodesk plans to further invest in strategic priority areas related to digital infrastructure, c ustomer success, and construction. By re-balancing resources to better align with the Company's strategic priorities, Autodesk is positioning itself to meet its long-term goals. This world-wide restructuring plan included a reduction in force of approximate ly 11% of the Company's workforce, or 1,027 employees, and the consolidation of certain leased facilities. By January 31, 2019, the personnel and facilities related actions included in this restructuring plan were substantially complete.

During Fiscal 2019, restructuring charges under the Fiscal 2018 Plan included $39.2 million in employee termination benefits and $3.2 million in lease termination and other exit costs.
