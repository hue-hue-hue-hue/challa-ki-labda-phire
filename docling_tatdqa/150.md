## 7. Credit Facility

In November 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the ''2016 Credit Facility'') with Silicon Valley Bank (''SVB'') as the lender. The 2016 Credit Facility provided a three-year, $25.0 million revolving credit facility, which included a maximum of $25.0 million letter of credit subfacility. Loan advances under the revolving facility were available of up to the full $25.0 million when the balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities minus outstanding revolving loans and letters of credit equaled or exceeded $50.0 million. If our net cash fell below $50.0 million, loan advances were determined based on a borrowing base equal to a specified percentage of the value of our eligible accounts receivable. Loans bore interest, at our option, at (i) the prime rate reported in The Wall Street Journal, minus 0.50% or (ii) a LIBOR rate determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility, plus 2.50%. Over the term of the 2016 Credit Facility, we paid customary closing fees, commitment fees and letter of credit fees for a facility of this size and type.

In September 2018, we entered into an amendment with SVB to reduce the unused revolving credit facility fee on the 2016 Credit Facility from 0.4% to 0.3%.

Our obligations under the 2016 Credit Facility were secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property. The 2016 Credit Facility required us to maintain compliance with customary affirmative and negative covenants, including compliance with an adjusted quick ratio of not less than 1.50:1.00, as determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility and restricted our ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions on our capital stock.

On November 1, 2019, the maturity date, we elected to allow the 2016 Credit Facility to expire without renewal. There were no outstanding loans or advances as of the maturity date. We currently have no plans for entering into a new borrowing facility.
