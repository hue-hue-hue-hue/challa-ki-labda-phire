## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

## 6.2 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONTINUED)

## 6.2.2 Share-based payments (continued)

## Sign-on and retention rights

The performance rights sub-plan has also been used to compensate new hires for foregone equity, and ensure that key employees are retained to protect and deliver on the Group's strategic direction. It has been offered to:

- · Executives of newly acquired businesses in order to retain intellectual property during transition periods; or
- · Attract new executives, generally from overseas; or
- · Middle management or executives deemed to be top talent who had either no or relatively small grants scheduled to vest over the ensuing two years.

Sign-on and retention rights generally do not have performance measures attached to them due to the objective of retaining key talent and vest subject to the executive remaining employed by the Group, generally for two or more years.

## Recognition share plan

The performance rights sub-plan has also been used to compensate employees of the Group. Participants are required to meet a service condition and other performance measures to gain access to the performance rights.
