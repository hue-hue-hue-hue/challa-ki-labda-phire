The movements in losses recognised for the period ended 30 March 2019 is £nil (2017/18: £1.1m). Corporation tax losses are not recognised where future recoverability is uncertain.

The adjustments to prior periods of £1.7m (2017/18: £(8.1m)) relate mainly to the adjustment of prior period losses and capital allowances which have been revised following submission of tax returns.

## Deferred tax

Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences using the tax rate appropriate to the jurisdiction in which the asset/(liability) arises and the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled. In all cases this is 17.0% (2017/18: 17.0%).
