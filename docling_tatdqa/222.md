## a. Analysis of revenue growth

On a reported basis, TCS' revenue grew 19% in FY 2019, compared to 4.4% in the prior year. This was largely an outcome of greater demand for our services and solutions during the year, driven by expanding participation in our customers' growth and transformation initiatives. In addition, there was some benefit from the movement in currency exchange rates.

FY 2019 saw volatility in USD-INR, ranging from ' 64.90 and ' 74.10, and averaging at ' 70.07. There was also significant volatility in exchange rates of emerging markets' currencies. Average currency exchange rates during FY 2019 for the three major currencies are given below:
