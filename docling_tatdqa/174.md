Sales by Contract Type: Substantially all of our contracts are fixed-price type contracts. Sales included in Other contract types represent cost plus and time and material type contracts.

On a fixed-price type contract, we agree to perform the contractual statement of work for a predetermined sales price. On a cost-plus type contract, we are paid our allowable incurred costs plus a profit which can be fixed or variable depending on the contract's fee arrangement up to predetermined funding levels determined by the customer. On a time-andmaterial type contract, we are paid on the basis of direct labor hours expended at specified fixed-price hourly rates (that include wages, overhead, allowable general and administrative expenses and profit) and materials at cost.
