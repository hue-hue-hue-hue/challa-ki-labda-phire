## Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets

The carrying amount of indefinite-lived intangible assets were as follows (in millions):

|                | December 31,   | December 31,   |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
|                | 2019           | 2018           |
| FCC licenses   | $ 136.2        | $ 120.6        |
| State licenses | 2.5            | 2.5            |
| Total          | $ 138.7        | $ 123.1        |

The Broadcasting segment strategically acquires assets across the United States, which results in the recording of FCC licenses. Providing the Company acts within the requirements and constraints of the regulatory authorities, the renewal and extension of these licenses is reasonably certain at minimal costs. Accordingly, we have concluded that the acquired FCC licenses are indefinite-lived intangible assets.

In 2019, FCC licenses increased $15.6 million, $18.2 million of which was through acquisitions, offset by $2.3 million of impairments and $0.3 million loss on the sale of licenses. Our Broadcasting segment recorded the impairment as a result of its decision to forfeit FCC licenses in certain lower-ranked markets, and does not expect any significant changes to future cash flows as a result of these forfeitures. The Company reports intangible impairment charges within the Asset impairment expense line of our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
