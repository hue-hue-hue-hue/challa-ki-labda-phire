## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

For the year ended 31 December 2019

## 3 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)

## 3.3 Fair value estimation (continued)

If one or more of the significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.

Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments mainly include:

- GLYPH<127> Dealer quotes for similar instruments;
- GLYPH<127> The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves; and
- GLYPH<127> Other techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine fair value for financial instruments.

During the year ended 31 December 2019, there was 1 transfer between level 1 and 2 for recurring fair value measurements. For transfers in and out of level 3 measurements see the following table, which presents the changes of financial instruments in level 3 for the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018:
