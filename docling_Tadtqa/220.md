The Company's effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was favorably impacted primarily by excess tax benefits related to employee stock-based payment transactions and federal research tax credits, partially offset by an increase in valuation allowances arising from foreign withholding tax and an increase in taxes related to the sale of the commercial cybersecurity business.

The Company's effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was favorably impacted primarily by a decrease in valuation allowances arising from the taxable conversion of a subsidiary and the utilization of capital losses, an increase in deferred tax assets related to stock basis of a subsidiary held for sale, excess tax benefits related to employee stock-based payment transactions and federal research tax credits.

The Company's effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was favorably impacted primarily by the Tax Act's reduction of the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% applied to the Company's fiscal 2017 year-end deferred tax balances and excess tax benefits related to employee stock-based payment transactions.
