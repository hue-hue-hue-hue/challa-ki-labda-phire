General and administrative expenses in 2019 decreased by $2.7 million, or 20%, as compared to 2018. Compensation and benefits expense decreased by $2.1 million in 2019, primarily due to reductions in headcount and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense, driven by employee turnover and the decline in our stock price. The decrease was further driven by the reduction in our provision for bad debts of $0.3 million in 2019, primarily due to improved efforts to collect on long outstanding and reserved receivables. We also did not incur restructuring costs in 2019, as compared to 2018 when $0.2 million was incurred as part of the 2018 Restructuring Plan (refer to Note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements).

The benefit from income taxes in 2019 totaled $0.1 million, as compared to a provision for income taxes of $0.6 million in 2018. The primary driver for this change was the current foreign income tax provision, which was $0.2 million in 2019, as compared to $0.9 million in 2018. In 2019, there was a net benefit of $0.3 million from the reserve for uncertain foreign tax positions primarily due to the close of the statute of limitations on several such positions during the year. This compared to 2018, when there was a $0.4 million net expense related to the reserve for uncertain foreign tax positions. The remaining decrease in the current foreign income tax provision was primarily due to reduced profits earned by our wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries as compared to 2018.
