The accounting for equity-based compensation expense requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect its financial statements. These estimates for stock options include the following.

Expected Dividend Yield-The Company uses an expected dividend yield based upon expected annual dividends and the Company's stock price.

Expected Volatility-The Company uses its historical volatility for a period commensurate with the expected term of the option.

Risk-Free Interest Rate-The Company uses the zero coupon US Treasury rate during the quarter having a term that most closely resembles the expected term of the option.

Expected Term of the Option-The Company estimates the expected life of the option term by analyzing historical stock option exercises.

Forfeiture Rates-The Company estimates its forfeiture rate based on historical data with further consideration given to the class of employees to whom the options or shares were granted.

The weighted-average per share grant date fair value of options was $8.92 in 2019, $8.45 in 2018 and $7.06 in 2017. The following assumptions were used for determining the fair value of options granted in the three years ended December 31, 2019:
