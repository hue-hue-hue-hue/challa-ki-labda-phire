Kyocera notified AVX pursuant to the Products Supply and Distribution Agreement in December 2016 of its intent, effective January 1, 2018, to market its manufactured electronic and interconnect products globally using Kyocera's sales force rather than continuing to have AVX resell such products in the Americas, Europe and Asia. During fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019 sales of Kyocera resale products by AVX were $318,928, $296,316 and $18,951, respectively, and related operating profit was $17,076, $18,177 and $3,300, respectively.

## 17. Segment and Geographic Information:

Our operating segments are based on the types of products from which we generate revenues. We are organized by product lines with four main product groups and two reportable segments: Electronic Components and Interconnect Sensing and Control Devices. The product groups of Ceramic, Advanced, and Tantalum have been aggregated into the Electronic Components reportable segment in accordance with the aggregation criteria and quantitative thresholds. The aggregation criteria consist of similar economic characteristics, products and services, production processes, customer classes, and distribution channels. The Electronic Components segment consists primarily of surface mount and leaded ceramic capacitors, RF thick and thin film components, surface mount and leaded tantalum capacitors, surface mount and leaded film capacitors, ceramic and film power capacitors, super capacitors, EMI filters (bolt in and surface mount), thick and thin film packages of multiple electronic integrated components, varistors, thermistors, inductors, and resistive products manufactured by us or purchased from other manufacturers for resale. The Interconnect, Sensing and Control Devices segment consists primarily of automotive sensing and control devices and automotive, telecom, and memory connectors manufactured by or for AVX. Historically, KED Resale reported as its own product group, but it has now been combined with Advanced Components. Sales and operating results from these reportable segments are shown in the tables below. In addition, we have a corporate administration group consisting of finance, legal, environmental, health & safety ("EH&S"), and administrative activities.

We evaluate performance of our segments based upon sales and operating profit. There are no intersegment revenues. We allocate the costs of shared resources between segments based on each segment's usage of the shared resources. Cash, accounts receivable, investments in securities, and certain other assets, which are centrally managed, are not readily allocable to operating segments.

The tables below present information about reported segments:
