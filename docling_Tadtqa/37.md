- 1 Throughout this report, certain non-IFRS information, such as EBITDA, EBIT, Net Profit after Tax (NPAT), Earnings Per Share (EPS), Conversion Ratio, Leads and Revenue Per Sale (RPS) are used. Earnings before interest and income tax expense (EBIT) reflects profit for the year prior to including the effect of net finance costs and income taxes. Earnings before interest, income tax expense, depreciation and amortisation and loss on associate (EBITDA) reflects profits for the year prior to including the effect of net finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortisation and loss on associate. The individual components of EBITDA and EBIT are included as line items in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income. Non-IFRS information is not audited. Reference to underlying results excludes the financial impacts of iMoney performance, impairment losses and write-offs from discontinued assets and operations, and material one-off transactions resulting from operations which are no longer core to the business.
