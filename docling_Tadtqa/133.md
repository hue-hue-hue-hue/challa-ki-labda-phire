## Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The weighted average estimated fair value, as defined by the amended authoritative guidance, of rights issued pursuant to the Company's ESPP during 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $4.28, $5.18 and $6.02, respectively. Sales under the ESPP were 24,131 shares of common stock at an average price per share of $9.76 for 2019, 31,306 shares of common stock at an average price per share of $15.40 for 2018, and 38,449 shares of common stock at an average price per share of $12.04 for 2017.

As of December 29, 2019, 62,335 shares under the 2009 ESPP remained available for issuance. The Company recorded compensation expenses related to the ESPP of $60,000, $205,000 and $153,000 in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

The fair value of rights issued pursuant to the Company's ESPP was estimated on the commencement date of each offering period using the following weighted average assumptions:

|                         | Fiscal Years   | Fiscal Years   | Fiscal Years   |
|-------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
|                         | 2019           | 2018           | 2017           |
| Expected life (months)  | 6.0            | 6.0            | 6.1            |
| Risk-free interest rate | 2.37 %         | 2.26 %         | 1.22 %         |
| Volatility              | 54 %           | 50 %           | 53 %           |
| Dividend yield          | -              | -              | -              |

The methodologies for determining the above values were as follows:

- · Expected term: The expected term represents the length of the purchase period contained in the ESPP.
- · Risk-free interest rate: The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon the risk-free rate of a Treasury Constant Maturity bond with a maturity appropriate for the term of the purchase period.
