## 4) Professional Service and Other:

Professional service and other revenues consist of revenues from consulting contracts and contracts to provide implementation, training and integration services (professional services). Other revenues consist of hardware revenues, which are grouped within the "Professional service and other" category because they are relatively immaterial to our service revenues. Professional services are typically performed after the purchase of new software licenses. Professional service and other revenues can vary from period to period based on the type of engagements as well as those implementations that are assumed by our partner network.

Cost of professional service and other revenues consists primarily of the costs of providing integration, configuration and training with respect to our various software products. The most significant components of these costs are personnel-related expenses, travel costs and third party subcontracting.
