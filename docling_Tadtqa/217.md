The following is a calculation of basic and diluted net income per share (in millions, except per share amounts):

|                                                | April 26, 2019   | Year Ended  April 27, 2018   | April 28, 2017   |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------------------|------------------|
| Numerator:                                     |                  |                              | $\_{  }$          |
| Net income                                     | $  1,169         | $  116                       | $  481           |
| Denominator:                                   |                  |                              | $\_{  }$          |
| Shares used in basic computation               | 254              | 268                          | 275              |
| Dilutive impact of employee equity award plans | 5                | 8                            | 6                |
| Shares used in diluted computation             | 259              | 276                          | 281              |
| Net Income per Share:                          |                  |                              | $\_{  }$          |
| Basic                                          | $  4.60          | $  0.43                      | $  1.75          |
| Diluted                                        | $  4.51          | $  0.42                      | $  1.71          |

Potential shares from outstanding employee equity awards totaling 1 million, 1 million and 6 million for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were excluded from the diluted net income per share calculations as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

## 16. Segment, Geographic, and Significant Customer Information

We operate in one industry segment: the design, manufacturing, marketing, and technical support of high-performance storage and data management solutions. We conduct business globally, and our sales and support activities are managed on a geographic basis. Our management reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis, accompanied by disaggregated information it receives from our internal management system about revenues by geographic region, based on the location from which the customer relationship is managed, for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. We do not allocate costs of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing, or general and administrative expenses to our geographic regions in this internal management reporting because management does not review operations or operating results, or make planning decisions, below the consolidated entity level.

Summarized revenues by geographic region based on information from our internal management system and utilized by our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered our Chief Operating Decision Maker, is as follows (in millions):
