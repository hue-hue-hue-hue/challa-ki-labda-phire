Franchise acquisitions - In 2019 and 2018 we did not acquire any franchise restaurants. In 2017 we acquired 50 franchise restaurants. Of the 50 restaurants acquired, we took over 31 restaurants as a result of an agreement with an underperforming franchisee who was in violation of franchise and lease agreements with the Company. Under this agreement, the franchisee voluntarily agreed to turn over the restaurants. The acquisition of the additional 19 restaurants in 2017 was the result of a legal action filed in September 2013 against a franchisee, from which legal action we obtained a judgment in January 2017 granting us possession of the restaurants. Of the 50 restaurants acquired in 2017, we closedeight and sold 42 to franchisees.
