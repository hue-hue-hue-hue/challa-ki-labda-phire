## Net financial result

The net financial result from continuing operations primarily comprises the interest result of €-119 million (2017/18: €-136 million) and the other financial result of €1 million (2017/18: €-2 million). Net interest result improved significantly as a result of more favourable refinancing terms.

- For more information about the net financial result, see the notes to the consolidated financial statements in no. 7 - earnings share of operating/non-operating companies recognised at equity page 202 , no. 8 - other investment result page 203 , no. 9 - net interest income/interest expenses page 203 and no. 10 - other financial result page 204 .

## Taxes

At €298 million (2017/18: €216 million), recognised income tax expenses are €81 million higher than the previous year's figures.

During the reporting period, the group tax rate for the continuing segment is 42.0% (2017/18: 37.6%). The group tax rate represents the relationship between recognised income tax expenses and earnings before taxes. The increase in the ratio in the current financial year is mainly attributable to impairments on deferred taxes on loss carry-forwards in Germany. The comparatively low ratio in the previous year includes positive one-off tax effects such as tax rate changes abroad and the reduction for risk provisions.

## Profit or loss for the period and earnings per share

The profit or loss for the period from continuing operations in financial year 2018/19 was € 411 million, €52 million higher than the profit or loss for the period of the previous year (2017/18: €359 million).

The profit or loss for the period from continuing and discontinued METRO operations was €-115 million in financial year 2018/19, and was thus €-453million below the net result for the period for the previous year's period (2017/18: €337 million). This decrease was mainly due to an impairment of €401 million in the hypermarket business.
