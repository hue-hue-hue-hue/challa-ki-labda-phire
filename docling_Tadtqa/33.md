## Note:

- (1) Refers to Singtel Group excluding Optus.

The Group's free cash flow grew 1.2% to S$3.65 billion. The increase was driven by lower capital expenditure partly offset by lower operating cash flow, higher cash taxes and lower associates' dividends.

Net cash inflow from operating activities declined 9.9% to S$5.37 billion. Dividends received from the associates fell 6.0% mainly from Telkomsel, the Southern Cross consortium and NetLink Trust.

The investing cash outflow was S$2.33 billion. During the year,

Singtel received proceeds of S$118 million from the disposal of a property in Singapore. Payments of S$123 million were made for the acquisition of Videology assets in August 2018 and S$344 million for the acquisition of a 5.7% equity interest in Airtel Africa in October 2018. Capital expenditure totalled S$1.72 billion, comprising S$587 million for Singtel and S$1.13 billion (A$1.14 billion) for Optus. In Singtel, major capital investments in the year included S$215 million for fixed and data infrastructure, S$183 million for mobile networks and S$189 million for ICT and other investments.

In Optus, capital investments in mobile networks amounted to A$633 million with the balance in fixed and other investments.

Net cash outflow for financing activities amounted to S$3.06 billion. Major cash outflows included net interest payments of S$385 million, and payments of S$1.75 billion for final dividends in respect of FY 2018 and S$1.11 billion for interim dividends in respect of FY 2019, partly offset by increase in net borrowings of S$222 million.
