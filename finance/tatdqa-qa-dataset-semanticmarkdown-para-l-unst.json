            "Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products, taxes, interest payments and leased facilities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased during fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to certain unfavorable cash changes in working capital balances, primarily unfavorable changes associated with income taxes including the first installment payment made pursuant to the transition tax provisions of the Tax Act during fiscal 2019 (see additional discussion of future installment payments pursuant to the Tax Act's transition tax under \"Contractual Obligations\" below). Cash flows from investing activities: The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to our acquisitions, the timing of our purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable debt securities and investments in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our growth. Net cash provided by investing activities was $26.6 billion during fiscal 2019 compared to $5.6 billion of net cash used for investing during fiscal 2018. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2019 was primarily due to an increase in sales and maturities of, and a decrease in purchases of, marketable securities and other investments. Cash flows from financing activities: The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments as well as stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs. Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2019 increased compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to increased stock repurchases as we used $36.1 billion of cash to repurchase common stock during fiscal 2019 compared to $11.3 billion during fiscal 2018.",

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased during fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to certain unfavorable cash changes in working capital balances, primarily unfavorable changes associated with income taxes including the first installment payment made pursuant to the transition tax provisions of the Tax Act during fiscal 2019 (see additional discussion of future installment payments pursuant to the Tax Act's transition tax under \"Contractual Obligations\" below). Cash flows from investing activities: The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to our acquisitions, the timing of our purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable debt securities and investments in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our growth. Net cash provided by investing activities was $26.6 billion during fiscal 2019 compared to $5.6 billion of net cash used for investing during fiscal 2018. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2019 was primarily due to an increase in sales and maturities of, and a decrease in purchases of, marketable securities and other investments. Cash flows from financing activities: The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments as well as stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs. Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2019 increased compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to increased stock repurchases as we used $36.1 billion of cash to repurchase common stock during fiscal 2019 compared to $11.3 billion during fiscal 2018.",

The objective of these instruments is to reduce variability in the forecasted interest payments of the Company's Variable Rate Loans, which is based on the LIBOR rate. Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements, the Company will receive monthly variable interest payments based on the one-month LIBOR rate and will pay interest at a fixed rate. In February 2018, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the cash flows of an additional $250 million of its Variable Rate Loans. The interest rate swap agreements on $1.1 billion of the Company's Variable Rate Loans had a maturity date of December 2021 and a fixed interest rate of 1.08%. The interest rate swap agreements on $300 million and $250 million of the Company's Variable Rate Loans both had a maturity date of August 2022 and fixed interest rates of 1.66% and 2.59%, respectively. The counterparties to these agreements are financial institutions.",
            "\nIn November 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the ''2016 Credit Facility'') with Silicon Valley Bank (''SVB'') as the lender. The 2016 Credit Facility provided a three-year, $25.0 million revolving credit facility, which included a maximum of $25.0 million letter of credit subfacility. Loan advances under the revolving facility were available of up to the full $25.0 million when the balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities minus outstanding revolving loans and letters of credit equaled or exceeded $50.0 million. If our net cash fell below $50.0 million, loan advances were determined based on a borrowing base equal to a specified percentage of the value of our eligible accounts receivable. Loans bore interest, at our option, at (i) the prime rate reported in The Wall Street Journal, minus 0.50% or (ii) a LIBOR rate determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility, plus 2.50%. Over the term of the 2016 Credit Facility, we paid customary closing fees, commitment fees and letter of credit fees for a facility of this size and type. In September 2018, we entered into an amendment with SVB to reduce the unused revolving credit facility fee on the 2016 Credit Facility from 0.4% to 0.3%. Our obligations under the 2016 Credit Facility were secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property. The 2016 Credit Facility required us to maintain compliance with customary affirmative and negative covenants, including compliance with an adjusted quick ratio of not less than 1.50:1.00, as determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility and restricted our ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions on our capital stock. On November 1, 2019, the maturity date, we elected to allow the 2016 Credit Facility to expire without renewal. There were no outstanding loans or advances as of the maturity date.",

Fiscal year 2019 Advanced Components group sales include $113.3 million of Ethertronics product as compared to $12.7 million for fiscal year 2018.

            "\nNet sales for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019 were $1,361.2 million, a decrease of $141.7 million, or 9.4%, from net sales of $1,502.9 million for fiscal 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower selling prices for non-specialty eggs in fiscal 2019 due to the oversupply of eggs, particularly in the last half of the fiscal year, contrasted with fiscal 2018 in which we experienced strong demand resulting in higher prices for non-specialty eggs. In fiscal 2019, shell egg sales made up approximately 97% of our net sales. Total dozens sold in fiscal 2019 were 1,038.9 million, an increase of 1.2 million dozen, or 0.1%, compared to 1,037.7 million sold in fiscal 2018 resulting in an increase in net sales of $1.7 million for fiscal 2019 compared with the prior year. Net average selling price of shell eggs decreased from $1.397 per dozen for fiscal 2018 to $1.265 per dozen for fiscal 2019, a decrease of $0.132 per dozen, or 9.4%, primarily reflecting an abundance of eggs in the market. The decrease in sales price in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2018 resulted in a corresponding decrease in net sales of approximately $137.1 million. Our operating results are significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices, which are outside of our control. Small changes in production or demand levels can have a large effect on shell egg prices. Egg products accounted for approximately 3% of our net sales. These revenues were $41.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019 compared with $43.5 million for the fiscal 2018. The table below represents an analysis of our non-specialty and specialty, as well as co-pack specialty, shell egg sales.

            "\nNet sales for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019 were $1,361.2 million, a decrease of $141.7 million, or 9.4%, from net sales of $1,502.9 million for fiscal 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower selling prices for non-specialty eggs in fiscal 2019 due to the oversupply of eggs, particularly in the last half of the fiscal year, contrasted with fiscal 2018 in which we experienced strong demand resulting in higher prices for non-specialty eggs. In fiscal 2019, shell egg sales made up approximately 97% of our net sales. Total dozens sold in fiscal 2019 were 1,038.9 million, an increase of 1.2 million dozen, or 0.1%, compared to 1,037.7 million sold in fiscal 2018 resulting in an increase in net sales of $1.7 million for fiscal 2019 compared with the prior year. Net average selling price of shell eggs decreased from $1.397 per dozen for fiscal 2018 to $1.265 per dozen for fiscal 2019, a decrease of $0.132 per dozen, or 9.4%, primarily reflecting an abundance of eggs in the market. The decrease in sales price in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2018 resulted in a corresponding decrease in net sales of approximately $137.1 million. Our operating results are significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices, which are outside of our control. Small changes in production or demand levels can have a large effect on shell egg prices. Egg products accounted for approximately 3% of our net sales. These revenues were $41.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019 compared with $43.5 million for the fiscal 2018.

            "loss carry-forwards and certain U.S. state tax credits that management does not anticipate will be utilized. No valuation allowance was recorded in 2019 against the U.S. federal foreign tax credit carryforwards of $5,785, which expire in varying amounts between 2023 and 2029 as well as the research and development tax credits of $7,495, which expire in varying amounts between 2021 and 2039. We assessed the anticipated realization of those tax credits utilizing future taxable income projections. Based on those projections, management believes it is more-likely-than-not that we will realize the benefits of these credit carryforwards.

In addition, the Company has $0.3 million of federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards that will be refundable in future years, due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act described below. The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred taxes are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the temporary differences reverse.",
            "\nIn fiscal years 2019 and 2018, the Company continued to maintain a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance increased by $1.7 million in fiscal year 2019. The Company recorded an income tax expense from continuing operations of $39,000 in fiscal year 2019. In fiscal year 2018, the Company recorded an income tax benefit from continuing operations of $597,000. The fiscal year 2018 income tax benefit was due primarily from the release of the tax valuation allowance associated with previously generated alternative minimum tax (AMT) credits due to the December 22, 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Tax Reform (the \"Tax Act\"). The Company has, on a tax-effected basis, approximately $0.8 million in tax credit carryforwards and $26.9 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that are available to offset taxable income in the future. The tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal year 2021. The federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in fiscal year 2022. State tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards, on a tax effected basis and net of federal tax benefits, are $0.1 million and $8.1 million, respectively. The remaining state tax credit carryforwards and state net operating loss carry forwards begin to expire in fiscal year 2020. In fiscal year 2019, $1.2 million of state net operating loss carryforwards expired. The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes under ASC 740, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return."

Compensation and benefits expense decreased by $2.1 million in 2019, primarily due to reductions in headcount and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense, driven by employee turnover and the decline in our stock price. The decrease was further driven by the reduction in our provision for bad debts of $0.3 million in 2019, primarily due to improved efforts to collect on long outstanding and reserved receivables. We also did not incur restructuring costs in 2019, as compared to 2018 when $0.2 million was incurred as part of the 2018 Restructuring Plan (refer to Note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements)."
