As such, these general overhead expenses are reflected in cost of revenue and each functional operating expense.Cost of Revenue: Fiscal years ended July 31, 2019 2018 Change Amount % of totalrevenue Amount % of totalrevenue ($) (%) (In thousands, except percentages)Cost of revenue: License and subscription$64,798 9% $35,452 5% 29,346 83Maintenance16,499 2 14,783 2 1,716 12Services243,053 34 246,548 38 (3,495) (1)Total cost of revenue$324,350 45% $296,783 45% 27,567 9 Includes stock-based compensation of: Cost of license and subscription revenue$3,011 $1,002 2,009 Cost of maintenance revenue1,820 1,886 (66) Cost of services revenue22,781 21,856 925 Total$27,612 $24,744 2,868 The $29.3 million increase in our cost of license and subscription revenue was primarily attributable to increases of $14.9 million in personnel expenses, $8.6million in cloud infrastructure costs incurred in order to support the growth of our subscription offerings, $3.3 million in royalties, $1.8 million in professionalservices, and $0.9 million related to the amortization of internal-use software development and acquired intangible assets. Cloud infrastructure costs include $9.5million of hosting related costs that were recorded in cost of services revenue in fiscal year 2018. The treatment of these hosting related costs is consistent with thetreatment of the related revenue in each fiscal year.We anticipate higher cost of license and subscription revenue as we continue to invest in our cloud operations to increase operational efficiency and scalewhile growing our customer base.Cost of maintenance revenue increased by $1.7 million primarily due to the increase in personnel required to support our term and perpetual licensecustomers.Our cost of services revenue would have increased if cloud infrastructure costs totaling $9.5 million were not reclassified to cost of license and subscriptionrevenue, consistent with the treatment of the related revenue. Excluding the impact of this reclassification, third-party consultants billable to customers primarilyfor InsuranceNow implementation engagements increased by $3.2 million and personnel expenses related to new and existing employees increased by $2.8million.We had 781 professional service employees and 198 technical support and licensing operations employees at July 31, 2019 compared to 838 professionalservices employees and 121 technical support and licensing operations employees at July 31, 2018.",
            "During 2019, $27.5 million, or 13% of total revenue, was generated from EMEA, which remained relatively\n\nconstant compared to 2018.\n\n2018 Revenue Compared to 2017 Revenue\n\nTotal revenue decreased $3.2 million, or 1%, in 2018 compared to 2017. This decrease was due to a $5.2 million decrease in products revenue, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in services revenue. The decrease in products revenue was primarily driven by lower demand from our service provider customers in the Americas. Revenues from service provider customers decreased 10% in 2018 compared to 2017. Revenue from enterprise customers remained relatively constant in 2018 compared to 2017.\n\nProducts revenue decreased $5.2 million, or 3%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by lower demand from our service provider customers in the Americas, as well as decreases from EMEA, offset in part by a $2.6 million increase from the adoption of ASC 606 in 2018 and by the increase in products revenue primarily from Japan and Asia Pacific. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information related to our adoption of ASC 606.\n\nServices revenue increased $2.0 million, or 2%, in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily\n\nattributable to the increase in PCS sales in connection with our increased installed customer base.\n\nDuring 2018, $112.5 million, or 48%, of total revenue was generated from the Americas, which represents a 8% decrease compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower products revenue driven by lower demand from our service providers in the Americas.\n\nDuring 2018, $55.2 million, or 24%, of total revenue was generated from Japan, which represents a 7% increase in revenue compared to 2017. The increase was mainly due to higher product revenues driven by higher demand from our service providers in Japan.\n\nDuring 2018, $36.9 million, or 16%, of total revenue was generated from the Asia Pacific regions excluding Japan, which represents a 11% increase compared to 2017. The increase was driven primarily by higher products revenue as well as higher services revenue from PCS sales in connection with our increased installed customer base.\n\nDuring 2018, $27.6 million, or 12%, of total revenue was generated from EMEA, which remained relatively\n\nconsistent from 2017.\n\nCost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\n\nCost of revenue\n\nCost of products revenue is primarily comprised of cost of third-party manufacturing services and cost of inventory for the hardware component of our products. Cost of products revenue also includes warehouse personnel costs, shipping costs, inventory write-downs, certain allocated facilities and information technology infrastructure costs, and expenses associated with logistics and quality control.\n\nCost of services revenue is primarily comprised of personnel costs for our technical support, training and professional service teams. Cost of services revenue also includes the costs of inventory used to provide hardware replacements to end- customers under PCS contracts and certain allocated facilities and information technology infrastructure costs.\n\nA summary of our cost of revenue is as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nIncrease (Decrease) Percent Amount\n\nCost of revenue:\n\nProducts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

            "Table of Contents\n\nThe fair value measurements related to the Company's non-financial assets, such as intangible assets, assets held for sale\n\nand property, plant and equipment are based on available market prices at the measurement date based on transactions of similar assets and third-party independent appraisals, less costs to sell where appropriate. The Company classifies these measurements as Level 2.\n\nNote 7. Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nThe carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value because their maturity is less than three months. Management believes the carrying amount of the equity and cost-method investments materially approximated fair value at March 31, 2019 based upon unobservable inputs. The fair values of these investments have been determined as Level 3 fair value measurements. The fair values of the Company's line of credit borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements and approximate carrying value excluding debt issuance costs. Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities, the fair value of the Company's line of credit borrowings at March 31, 2019 approximated the carrying value and are considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described in Note 6. The carrying amount of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of the amounts and are considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nFair Value of Subordinated Convertible Debt, Senior Secured Notes, and Term Loan Facility\n\nThe Company measures the fair value of its senior and junior subordinated convertible debt and senior secured notes for\n\ndisclosure purposes. These fair values are based on observable market prices for this debt, which is traded in less active markets and are therefore classified as a Level 2 fair value measurement.\n\nThe following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's senior and junior subordinated\n\nconvertible debt, senior secured notes, and term loan facility as of March 31, 2019 and 2018 (in millions).\n\nMarch 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nCarrying Amount\n\nFair Value\n\nCarrying Amount\n\nFair Value\n\n2023 Senior Secured Notes\n\n$\n\n985.4\n\n$\n\n1,020.1\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\n2021 Senior Secured Notes\n\n$\n\n987.4\n\n$\n\n1,008.1\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nTerm Loan Facility\n\n$\n\n1,892.1\n\n$\n\n1,911.5\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\n2017 Senior Convertible Debt\n\n$\n\n1,493.6\n\n$\n\n2,285.4\n\n$\n\n1,437.6\n\n$\n\n2,459.2\n\n2015 Senior Convertible Debt\n\n$\n\n1,360.8\n\n$\n\n2,810.6\n\n$\n\n1,309.9\n\n$\n\n3,079.1\n\n2017 Junior Convertible Debt\n\n$\n\n335.9\n\n$\n\n740.8\n\n$\n\n326.7\n\n$\n\n876.9\n\n(1) The carrying amounts presented are net of debt discounts and debt issuance costs (see Note 12 Debt and Credit Facility for\n\nfurther information).\n\nNote 8.

Unrecognized tax benefits of $246 million, including penalties, interest and indirect benefits, would affect our provision for income taxes if recognized. As a result of U.S. tax reform, we recorded provisional gross unrecognized tax benefits of $114 million during fiscal 2018.\n\nWe recognized a benefit for adjustments to accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision of approximately $4 million in fiscal 2019 and expense of $5 million in each of fiscal 2018 and 2017.

            "Contingencies\n\nWe evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with\n\nthe authoritative guidance on contingencies. We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes from potential claims or proceedings, as well as potential ranges of probable losses, when the outcomes of the claims or proceedings are probable and reasonably estimable. A determination of the amount of an accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after the analysis of each separate matter. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, we base our estimates on the information available at the time of our assessment. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates.\n\nNote 2. Recent Accounting Standards\n\nRecently adopted authoritative guidance\n\nRevenue Recognition — Contracts with Customers. In May 2014, the FASB issued new authoritative guidance for revenue from contracts with customers. The standard’s core principle is that a company recognizes revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, companies are required to capitalize certain contract acquisition costs, including commissions paid, when contracts are signed. The asset recognized from capitalized incremental and recoverable acquisition costs is amortized on a straight-line basis consistent with the timing of transfer of the products or services to which the asset relates.\n\nAs a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance, our net revenue for fiscal\n\n2019 increased $47 million, and our operating expenses decreased $12 million. See Note 3 for additional information related to the impact of the new guidance on the timing and amounts of revenues recognized in fiscal 2019.\n\nThe effects of the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance on our March 29, 2019\n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:\n\n(In millions)\n\nAs Reported\n\nAs of March 29, 2019 Balances Without Adoption of New Standard\n\nEffect of Change\n\nAccounts receivable, net Other current assets (1) Other long-term assets (2) Total assets\n\n$ $ $ $\n\n708 435 1,262 15,938\n\n$ $ $ $\n\n657 421 1,213 15,824\n\n$ $ $ $\n\n51 14 49 114\n\nShort-term contract liabilities Other current liabilities Long-term contract liabilities Deferred income tax liabilities Total liabilities\n\n$ $ $ $ $\n\n2,320 533 736 577 10,200\n\n$ $ $ $ $\n\n2,437 494 837 526 10,328\n\n$ $ $ $ $\n\n(117) 39 (101) 51 (128)\n\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss Retained earnings Total stockholders’ equity\n\n$ $ $\n\n(7) $ $ $\n\n933 5,738\n\n(2) $ $ $\n\n686 5,496\n\n(5) 247 242\n\n(1)\n\nAs reported includes short-term deferred commissions of $92 million.

Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, consisting of net loss of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $26.2 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $16.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $10.0 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an outflow from the changes in accrued liabilities and other of $5.9 million and inventory of $5.6 million, partially offset by an inflow from changes in deferred revenue of $3.2 million.\n\nThe unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and other was driven by an increase in lease liabilities associated with the lease of the San Jose corporate office. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to build up of inventory and timing of shipments, partially offset by increased reserves. The favorable change in deferred revenues was primarily driven by increased bookings.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million, consisting of net loss of $27.6 million which includes payments for our internal investigation costs of $8.6 million, non-cash charges of $25.0 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.9 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $3.1 million, offset primarily by an outflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $6.1 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and inventory of $1.5 million.\n\nThe favorable change in deferred revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the sale of subscription and support. The favorable change in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, increased value added tax accrual due to timing of payments, and an increase in legal fees accrual. The unfavorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections. The unfavorable change in prepaid and other assets was mainly driven by the increase in deferred sales commissions due to higher deferred revenue and higher average commission rate. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to the timing of shipments.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $14.3 million, consisting of a net loss of $10.8 million, a cash decrease resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million and non-cash charges of $26.4 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $17.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance of $1.1 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $12.4 million and deferred revenue of $3.0 million, and an outflow from the change in accrued liabilities of $8.9 million, inventory of $4.7 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and accounts payable of $0.9 million.\n\n",
            "Table of Contents\n\nFree Cash Flow (non-U.S. GAAP measure). We also present Free Cash Flow, which is a non-U.S. GAAP measure, defined as (i) net cash from operating activities plus (ii) net cash used in investing activities, excluding payment for purchases (and proceeds from the sale) of marketable securities, and net cash variation for joint ventures deconsolidation, which are considered as temporary financial investments. The result of this definition is ultimately net cash from operating activities plus payment for purchase and proceeds from sale of tangible, intangible and financial assets, proceeds received in the sale of businesses and cash paid for business acquisitions. We believe Free Cash Flow, a non-U.S. GAAP measure, provides useful information for investors and management because it measures our capacity to generate cash from our operating and investing activities to sustain our operations. Free Cash Flow is not a U.S. GAAP measure and does not represent total cash flow since it does not include the cash flows generated by or used in financing activities. Free Cash Flow reconciles with the total cash flow and the net cash increase (decrease) by including the payment for purchases (and proceeds from the sale) of marketable securities and net cash variation from joint ventures deconsolidation, the net cash from (used in) financing activities and the effect of changes in exchange rates. In addition, our definition of Free Cash Flow may differ from definitions used by other companies. Free Cash Flow is determined from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as follows:\n\n2019\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 (In millions)\n\n2017\n\nNet cash from operating activities Net cash used in investing activities Excluding: Payment for purchase and proceeds from sale of marketable securities, and net cash variation for joint ventures deconsolidation Payment for purchase and proceeds from sale of tangible and intangible assets, payment for business acquisitions(1) Free Cash Flow (non-U.S. GAAP measure)\n\n$\n\n$\n\n1,869 $ (1,172)\n\n(200)\n\n(1,372) 497 $\n\n1,845 $ (1,212)\n\n(100)\n\n(1,312) 533 $\n\n1,677 (1,468)\n\n99\n\n(1,369) 308\n\n(1)\n\nReflects the total of the following line items reconciled with our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows relating to the investing activities: Payment for purchase of tangible assets, Proceeds from sale of tangible assets, Payment for purchase of intangible assets, Payment for purchase of financial assets, Proceeds from sale of financial assets, Payment for disposal of equity investment, Proceeds received in sale of businesses, Payment for business acquisitions, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired.\n\nFree Cash Flow was positive $497 million in 2019, compared to positive $533 million and positive $308\n\nmillion in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\n59"

EMPLOYEE STOCK AWARD AND BENEFIT PLANS (Continued)\n\nwithheld to cover tax payments was 120,000 in fiscal 2019, 131,000 in fiscal 2018 and 131,000 in fiscal 2017; tax payments made were $15.2 million, $36.3 million and $15.7 million, respectively.\n\n14. DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS\n\nAs a result of the Rofin acquisition, we have assumed all assets and liabilities of Rofin’s defined benefit plans for the Rofin-Sinar Laser, GmbH (‘‘RSL’’) and Rofin-Sinar Inc. (‘‘RS Inc.’’) employees. The U.S. plan began in fiscal 1995 and is partially funded. Any new employees hired after January 1, 2007, are not eligible for the RS Inc. pension plan. As is the customary practice with German companies, the German pension plan is unfunded. Any new employees hired after 2000 are not eligible for the RSL pension plan. The measurement date of these pension plans is September 30. For these pension plans, actuarial gains and losses are deferred into OCI and amortized over future periods.\n\nEffective January 1, 2012, the RS Inc. defined benefit plan was amended to exclude highly compensated employees, as defined by the Internal Revenue Service, from receiving future years of service under the RS Inc. defined benefit plan. A non-qualified defined benefit plan was created to replace the benefits lost by the employees that were otherwise excluded from the qualified defined benefit plan. Effective August 31, 2018 both the RS Inc. plans were amended to freeze all future compensation benefit accruals.\n\nIn addition, we have defined benefit plans in South Korea, Japan, Spain and Italy, covering all\n\nfull-time employees with at least one year of service, and a defined benefit plan in Germany covering two individuals. As is the customary practice with European and Asian companies, the plans are unfunded, with the exception of the Spanish plan which is partially funded. We have elected to recognize all actuarial gains and losses on these plans immediately, as incurred. The measurement date of these defined benefit plans is September 30.\n\nFor financial reporting purposes, the calculation of net periodic pension costs is based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations, an assumed rate of return on pension assets and an assumed rate of compensation increase for employees covered by the plan. All of these assumptions were based upon management’s judgment, considering all known trends and uncertainties. Actual results that differ from these assumptions would impact future expense recognition and the cash funding requirements of our defined benefit plans.\n\nComponents of net periodic cost are as follows for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\n\nFiscal\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nService cost . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

We make contributions to them based on various actuarial cost methods that are permitted by pension regulatory authorities. Contributions reflect actuarial assumptions about future investment returns, salary projections and future service benefits.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Expressed in US $000's except share and per share amounts\n\nAll cash equivalents and marketable securities mature within one year of the consolidated balance sheet date. There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3 during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\nAs at December 31, 2019 the Company held foreign exchange forward contracts to convert USD into CAD, with a total notional value of $285,700 (December 31, 2018 - $276,696), to fund a portion of its operations. The foreign exchange forward contracts have maturities of twelve months or less. The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and corporate bonds was based upon Level 2 inputs, which included period-end mid-market quotations for each underlying contract as calculated by the financial institution with which the Company has transacted. The quotations are based on bid/ask quotations and represent the discounted future settlement amounts based on current market rates.\n\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\n\nThe Company has a hedging program to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on future cash flows and earnings. Under this program the Company has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts with certain financial institutions and designated those hedges as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2019, $5,830 of unrealized gains related to changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges were included in accumulated other comprehensive loss and current assets, on the consolidated balance sheet. These amounts are expected to be reclassified into earnings over the next twelve months. In the year ended December 31, 2019, $5,181 of realized losses (December 31, 2018 - $4,170 of realized losses) related to the maturity of foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges were included in cost of revenues and operating expenses.

The Group recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime expected credit losses at each reporting date. The Group assesses this allowance based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors.

No shares were considered antidilutive for the year ended September 30, 2017.\n\nUse of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, related revenues and expenses and disclosure about contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Significant estimates include the rebates related to revenue recognition, stock based compensation and the valuation of inventory, long-lived assets, finite lived intangible assets and goodwill. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements: In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. There have been further amendments, including practical expedients, with the issuance of ASU 2018-01 in January 2018, ASU 2018-11 in July 2018 and ASU 2018-20 in December 2018. The amended guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those reporting periods, with early adoption permitted. The guidance will be applied on a modified retrospective basis with the earliest period presented. Based on the effective date, this guidance will apply beginning October 1, 2019. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have no impact to retained earnings or net income. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02 on October 1, 2019, we anticipate recording a right-of-use asset and an offsetting lease liability of approximately $2.3 to $2.9 million.\n\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 Intangibles-Goodwill, which offers amended guidance to simplify the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. A goodwill impairment will now be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This guidance is to be applied on a prospective basis effective for the Company’s interim and annual periods beginning after January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted for any impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. The Company does not believe the adoption of this ASU will have a material impact on our financial statements.\n\n36\n\n2017 3,847,839 13,532,375 128,431 13,660,806\n\n0.28 0."

All eligible employees were awarded free shares (or nil-cost options in the case of employees in Ireland) valued at £3,600 each based on the share price at the time of the Company’s admission to the Stock Exchange in March 2015, subject to a three-year service period (‘Vesting Period’). The SIP shareholders are entitled to dividends over the Vesting Period. There are no performance conditions applicable to the vesting of SIP shares. The fair value of the SIP awards at the grant date was measured to be £2.72 using the Black-Scholes model.

Options exercised prior to the vesting date relate to those attributable to good leavers as defined by the scheme rules.\n\nPerformance Share Plan The Group operates a Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) for Executive Directors, the Operating Leadership Team and certain key employees. The extent to which awards vest will depend upon the Group’s performance over the three-year period following the award date. Both market based and non-market based performance conditions may be attached to the options, for which an appropriate adjustment is made when calculating the fair value of an option. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire. Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest, unless under exceptional circumstances.\n\nOn 17 August 2018, the Group awarded 452,695 nil cost options under the PSP scheme. For the 2018 awards, the Group’s performance is measured by reference to the growth in Operating profit (75% of the award) and growth in Revenue (25% of the award) over the three-year period April 2018 – March 2021. For previous awards, the Group’s performance had been measured by reference to the cumulative profit measure (Underlying operating profit for 2015 and 2016 awards, and Operating profit for 2017 awards) and total shareholder return relative to the FTSE 250 share index.\n\n",
            "The fair value of the 2018 award was determined using a Black-Scholes pricing model. The PSP awards granted prior to 2018 have been valued using the Monte Carlo model for the TSR element and the Black-Scholes model for the Operating profit and Underlying operating profit element. The resulting share-based payments charge is being spread evenly over the period between the grant date and the vesting date.\n\nPSP award holders are entitled to receive dividends accruing between the grant date and the vesting date and this value will be delivered in shares.

The Plan consists of two schemes, the Deferred Annual (‘DAB’) and the Single Incentive Plan Award (‘SIPA’).\n\nDeferred Annual Bonus The Group operates a Deferred Annual scheme (‘DABP’) for Executive Directors and certain key senior executives. Awards under the plan are contingent on the satisfaction of pre-set internal targets relating to financial and operational objectives. Awards have a vesting period of two years from the date of the award (the ‘Vesting Period’) and are potentially forfeitable during that period should the employee leave employment. The DABP awards have been valued using the Black-Scholes method and the resulting share-based payments charge is being spread evenly over the combined Performance Period and Vesting Period of the shares, being three years.\n\nOn 16 June 2018, the Group awarded 71,552 nil cost options under the DABP scheme. The assumptions used in the measurement of the fair value at grant date of the DABP awards are as follows:\n\nGrant date\n\nShare price at grant date £\n\nExercise price £\n\nOption life years\n\nRisk-free rate %\n\nDividend yield %\n\nNon-vesting condition %\n\nFair value per option £\n\n17 June 2016\n\n3.89\n\nNil\n\n2.0\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.0\n\n3.89\n\n16 June 2017\n\n4.00\n\nNil\n\n2.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n4.00\n\n17 August 2018\n\n4.48\n\nNil\n\n2.0\n\n0.7\n\n1.7\n\n0.0\n\n4.48\n\n",

Other revenues consist of hardware revenues, which are grouped within the “Professional service and other” category because they are relatively immaterial to our service revenues. Professional services are typically performed after the purchase of new software licenses. Professional service and other revenues can vary from period to period based on the type of engagements as well as those implementations that are assumed by our partner network.\n\nCost of professional service and other revenues consists primarily of the costs of providing integration, configuration and\n\ntraining with respect to our various software products. The most significant components of these costs are personnel-related expenses, travel costs and third party subcontracting.\n\nYear Ended June 30,\n\n(In thousands)\n\n2019\n\nChange increase (decrease)\n\n2018\n\nChange increase (decrease)\n\nProfessional Service and Other Revenues:\n\nAmericas\n\n$\n\n132,426\n\n$\n\n(19,045)\n\n$\n\n151,471\n\n$\n\n39,872\n\n$\n\nEMEA\n\n122,861\n\n(8,982)\n\n131,843\n\n29,601\n\nAsia Pacific\n\n29,649\n\n(3,294)\n\n32,943\n\n11,468\n\nTotal Professional Service and Other Revenues\n\n284,936\n\n(31,321)\n\n316,257\n\n80,941\n\nCost of Professional Service and Other Revenues\n\n224,635\n\n(28,754)\n\n253,389\n\n58,435\n\nGAAP-based Professional Service and Other Gross Profit\n\n$\n\n60,301\n\n$\n\n(2,567)\n\n$\n\n62,868\n\n$\n\n22,506\n\n$\n\nGAAP-based Professional Service and Other Gross Margin %\n\n21.2%\n\n19.9%\n\n% Professional Service and Other Revenues by Geography:\n\nAmericas\n\n46.5%\n\n47.9%\n\nEMEA\n\n43.1%\n\n41.7%\n\nAsia Pacific\n\n10.4%\n\n10.4%\n\nProfessional service and other revenues decreased by $31.3 million or 9.9% during the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the prior fiscal year; down 7.4% after factoring the impact of $8.1 million of foreign exchange rate changes. Geographically, the overall change was attributable to a decrease in Americas of $19.0 million, a decrease in EMEA of $9.0 million and a decrease in Asia Pacific of $3.3 million.\n\nCost of Professional service and other revenues decreased by $28.8 million during the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the prior fiscal year as a result of a decrease in labour-related costs of approximately $29.0 million resulting primarily from a reduction in the use of external labour resources, partially offset by an increase in other miscellaneous costs of $0.2 million.\n\nOverall, the gross margin percentage on Professional service and other revenues increased to approximately 21% from\n\napproximately 20%.

These stock options were valued using a Black-Scholes model, using a volatility rate of 45.7%, a risk-free rate of 2.21%, a strike priceof $36.61 and an expected term of 6.5 years. Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period which approximated4.5 years for these awards.

Share-based compensation expense is recognized regardless of the number of awards that are earned based on the market condition and isrecognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated service period of approximately three years. If the required service period is not met for these options, thenthe share-based compensation expense would be reversed. In the event that our common stock achieves the target price per share based on a 30-day trailingaverage prior to the end of the estimated service period, any remaining unamortized compensation cost will be recognized.Stock options with market-based vesting criteria granted for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 were 585,000, 325,000 and 320,000, respectively, atweighted average grant date fair values of $7.47, $15.52 and $13.18 per share, or total grant date fair value $2.4 million, $5.0 million and $4.3 million,respectively.",

These stock options were valued using a Black-Scholes model, using a volatility rate of 45.7%, a risk-free rate of 2.21%, a strike priceof $36.61 and an expected term of 6.5 years.

Share-based compensation expense is recognized regardless of the number of awards that are earned based on the market condition and isrecognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated service period of approximately three years. If the required service period is not met for these options, thenthe share-based compensation expense would be reversed. In the event that our common stock achieves the target price per share based on a 30-day trailingaverage prior to the end of the estimated service period, any remaining unamortized compensation cost will be recognized.Stock options with market-based vesting criteria granted for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 were 585,000, 325,000 and 320,000, respectively, atweighted average grant date fair values of $7.47, $15.52 and $13.18 per share, or total grant date fair value $2.4 million, $5.0 million and $4.3 million,respectively.78\n\nThese NQs with market-based vesting criteria were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model.

The incremental compensation cost resulting from the modification was $8.2 million, and was being recognized asshare-based compensation expense over the requisite service period of three years for the new PRSU awards. As a result of subsequent actions that resulted inforfeitures, the remaining compensation expense associated with this modification as of September 27, 2019 is $2.8 million.Restricted Stock Awards and UnitsA summary of restricted stock awards and units activity for fiscal year 2019 is as follows (in thousands): Number of Shares Weighted-AverageGrant Date FairValue AggregateIntrinsic ValueIssued and unvested - September 28, 20181,872 $34.15 $38,452Granted2,977 18.18 Vested(673) 34.87 Forfeited, canceled or expired(1,563) 24.06 Issued and unvested - September 27, 20192,613 21.81 $56,649As of September 27, 2019, the aggregate intrinsic value of expected to vest restricted stock units including time-based, performance-based, and market-basedunits was $56.3 million for fiscal year 2019.

RSUs granted generally vest over a period of four years.In addition to RSUs, we also issue PRSUs with specific performance vesting criteria. These PRSUs have both a service and performance-based vestingcondition and awards are divided into three equal tranches and vest based on achieving certain adjusted earnings per share growth metrics. The service conditionrequires participants to be employed on May 15th of the following year once the performance condition has been met. Depending on the actual performanceachieved, a participant may earn between 0% to 300% of the targeted shares for each tranche, which is determined based on a straight-line interpolation appliedfor the achievement between the specified performance ranges. As of September 27, 2019, the performance condition targets for awards with future serviceconditions had not been met. We granted 1,005,854 PRSUs during fiscal year 2019 and 745,047 were forfeited."

Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $16.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $10.0 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an outflow from the changes in accrued liabilities and other of $5.9 million and inventory of $5.6 million, partially offset by an inflow from changes in deferred revenue of $3.2 million.\n\nThe unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and other was driven by an increase in lease liabilities associated with the lease of the San Jose corporate office. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to build up of inventory and timing of shipments, partially offset by increased reserves. The favorable change in deferred revenues was primarily driven by increased bookings.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million, consisting of net loss of $27.6 million which includes payments for our internal investigation costs of $8.6 million, non-cash charges of $25.0 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.9 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $3.1 million, offset primarily by an outflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $6.1 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and inventory of $1.5 million.\n\nThe favorable change in deferred revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the sale of subscription and support. The favorable change in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, increased value added tax accrual due to timing of payments, and an increase in legal fees accrual. The unfavorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections. The unfavorable change in prepaid and other assets was mainly driven by the increase in deferred sales commissions due to higher deferred revenue and higher average commission rate. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to the timing of shipments.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $14.3 million, consisting of a net loss of $10.8 million, a cash decrease resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million and non-cash charges of $26.4 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $17.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance of $1.1 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $12.4 million and deferred revenue of $3.0 million, and an outflow from the change in accrued liabilities of $8.9 million, inventory of $4.7 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and accounts payable of $0.9 million.\n\n",

Average headcount during fiscal year 2019,however, increased by 54 as compared to average headcount during fiscal year 2018, primarily due to the Cyence acquisition that closed on November 1, 2017,which resulted in increased personnel costs, despite the decrease in headcount as of the end of fiscal year 2019 versus the end of fiscal year 2018.We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to hire and dedicate internal resources to developing,improving, and expanding the functionality of our solutions and migrating our solutions to the cloud.

It also includes travel expenses, professionalservices for marketing activities, and amortization of certain acquired intangibles.The $6.6 million increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to increases of $14.2 million in personnel expenses due to higher headcount tosell our products and $1.4 million due to the amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease of $9.4 million due to the change in accounting forcommission costs under ASC 606. Under ASC 606, certain commissions are capitalized when earned and expensed over the anticipated period of time that goodsand services are expected to be provided to a customer, which we estimate to be approximately five years.Our sales and marketing headcount was 354 as of July 31, 2019 compared with 329 as of July 31, 2018.We expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in sales and marketing activities to supportour business growth and objectives.General and AdministrativeOur general and administrative expenses include executive, finance, human resources, legal, and corporate development and strategy functions, andprimarily consist of personnel costs, as well as professional services.The $1.5 million decrease in our general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease in professional services of $10.2 million,partially offset by increases of $6.1 million in personnel expenses due to higher headcount and $2.5 million in software and cloud infrastructure costs to supportour growth. Professional services were higher in the prior year period as a result of professional services incurred in connection with our acquisition of Cyence andimplementation costs of a new enterprise resource planning platform and a new product configuration and quoting system.Our general and administrative headcount was 298 as of July 31, 2019 compared with 255 as of July 31, 2018.

            "We measure and report our annual scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions. As part of our commitment to reduce our Greenhouse Gas (‘GHG’) emissions, we moved to a certified green tariff renewable electricity supply contract for our UK operations from the beginning of the financial year.\n\nThe GHG emissions summary below shows our gross emissions including location-based scope 2 emissions, as well as our net emissions accounting for the market-based scope 2 reporting for our certified green electricity tariff.\n\nThe reduction in emissions is driven by continued progress in energy efficiency, a reduction in emissions associated with refrigerants as we continue to move away from fluorinated gas refrigerants, and the general reduction in UK grid carbon factor as more renewables make up a greater proportion of the fuel mix.\n\nReducing packaging and plastics Packaging and plastic have played a vital role in safe food storage and distribution for decades, but now our approach to their use is changing. We work with our customers to look for the best packaging solutions for all our products, that take into account the environmental impact, while keeping our food fresher for longer. We are committed to working with our customers to reducing our use of single-use plastics and partnering with suppliers to find effective alternatives.\n\nWe support the UK Plastics Pact and are committed to meeting its 2025 targets. We will monitor and reduce the amount of plastics used to transport and consume our products, and we aim to develop a circular system whereby plastic is used less and kept out of the environment. Throughout FY19, we have engaged with all key customers and have plans to remove remaining ‘hard to recycle’ packaging as soon as possible.\n\nOver the last six years, we have made good progress in our water consumption per tonne of product, reducing it by 15% over the period. There was also a significant improvement in FY19, and one of the contributing factors to the improvement was the closure of the Evercreech desserts facility which had a higher water intensity than most sites within the business.\n\nWater consumption per tonne of product – UK manufacturing (m3 per tonne)\n\nIn FY19, we saved 18.7 tonnes of plastic by replacing the black plastic trays in a ready meal range with foil. Activities targeting relatively small pieces of plastic such as ‘windows’ on quiche boxes have also led to significant reductions in plastic use.\n\nWe have recycled 758 tonnes of plastic from our manufacturing and distribution activities in FY19 and have identified opportunities for further improvements in the future.\n\nFY19\n\n5.91\n\nFY18\n\n6.45\n\nPrimary energy consumption per tonne of product – UK manufacturing (kWhp per tonne)\n\nFY19\n\n1,235\n\nFY18\n\n1,299\n\nEmissions are summarised below, all reported as CO2 equivalent (‘CO2e’) Emissions from:\n\nEmissions reported in tonnes CO2e* FY19**\n\nFY18**\n\nFY18***\n\nCombustion of fuel and operation of facilities (Scope 1)\n\n59,495\n\n66,336\n\n75,600\n\nElectricity, heat, steam and cooling purchased for own use (Scope 2)\n\n27,633\n\n32,389\n\n67,754\n\nTotal gross emissions (Scope 1 and 2)\n\n87,128\n\n98,725\n\n143,354\n\nGreen tariff\n\n27,603\n\n0\n\n0\n\nTotal net emissions (Scope 1 and 2)\n\n59,525\n\n98,725\n\n143,354\n\nRatio (KgCO2e per £1 sales revenue)\n\n0.060\n\n0.066\n\n0.056\n\nOur GHG emissions have been calculated using the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, and emissions factors from DEFRA’s\n\nUK government GHG conversion factors for company reporting (where factors have not been provided directly by a supplier).\n\n** UK & Ireland only – comparable with FY19 Group structure. *** Full Group including US business.\n\nAnnual Report and Financial Statements 2019\n\n",

In 2019 our staff completed more than 710 hours of volunteering and donated in excess of $31,000 to good causes.\n\nProperty Energy use Spirent’s energy use decreased by 2.3 per cent in 2019 to 14,187MWh. This has been primarily driven by our efficiency initiatives delivering strong energy reductions in North America and APAC. There was an increase in energy use in EMEA, driven by the opening of new sites in the UK and Finland, and an increase in energy use at our site in Paris. Gas use also increased in the year by 7 per cent, with all sites seeing similar increases over 2018.\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions Spirent is committed to acting to combat climate change and reporting its progress. Our total Scope 1 and 2 emissions dropped by 6.14 per cent from 2018, and our emissions per $ million of revenue were down by 10.9 per cent. We have reduced our total emissions by 29 per cent since our 2014 baseline.\n\nThe Group responded to the Carbon Disclosure Project in 2019, completing the Climate Change and Supply Chain questionnaires. In 2019 we achieved a Climate Change rating of B (management) (2018 C) and a Supplier Engagement rating of B (management) (2018 B). The average for our sector is C in both categories.\n\nMethodology Reporting on emission sources is required under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors Report) Regulations 2013 and these sources fall within our consolidated financial statements. We have reported on all the emission sources that fall within our consolidated financial statements. We do not have any responsibility for any emission sources that are not included in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe have used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition), along with data gathered to fulfil our requirements under these Regulations, and the most recent emission factors available: UK Government’s GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2019 for the UK, US EPA 2018 eGrid emissions factors for the applicable individual states in the US, and 2018 emissions factors for all other countries were sourced from the International Energy Agency’s 2019 data set.\n\nPerformance against target The Group set a target to reduce carbon emissions by five per cent relative to revenue from 2018 figures. We have achieved this target, having reduced carbon emissions per $million of revenue by 10.9 per cent.\n\nCompliance The Group is not required to comply with stages 1 or 2 of the UK Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (ESOS) Regulations 2014.\n\nProcurement Vendor assessment and auditing Vendors are required to abide by our Code of Conduct which sets out our expectations for environmental management, labour and human rights, health and safety, and business ethics. They are assessed using a detailed questionnaire.\n\nIn addition, priority suppliers are audited by Spirent’s procurement team: 22 supplier audits were conducted in 2019, representing 88.7 per cent of our hardware supply chain spend. This exceeded our target of completing 18 audits in the year. No material issues were identified.\n\nCompliance We comply with the requirements of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act 2010. We require slavery and human trafficking to be eradicated from our direct supply chain for the products we sell and monitor suppliers by performing regular evaluation surveys to assure ourselves of each supplier’s commitment in this area.\n\nSpirent’s full statement on Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking can be found on the Company’s website at https://corporate.spirent.com.\n\nSpirent Communications plc Annual Report 2019\n\n",

If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\nGoodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the cash-generating unit to which it relates is greater than the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use.\n\nFor the year-ended 31 March 2019, the Directors have reviewed the value of goodwill based on internal value in use calculations. The key assumptions for these calculations are discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to billings and direct costs during the period.\n\nThe Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the Directors’ most recent financial forecasts for the following five years. The growth rates for the five-year period are based on Directors’ expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the cash-generating unit, planned growth in market share, industry forecasts, growth in the market and specific regional considerations and are in line with past experience. Discount rates have been estimated based on rates that reflect current market assessments of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital.\n\nThe key assumptions used in the assessments in the year-ended 31 March 2019 are as follows:\n\nAmericas\n\nEMEA\n\nAPJ\n\nLong-term regional growth rate beyond five years\n\n2.5%\n\n1.5%\n\n2.0%\n\nDiscount rate\n\n9.0%\n\n9.0%\n\n10.0%\n\nThe key assumptions used in the assessments in the year-ended 31 March 2018 were as follows:\n\nAmericas\n\nEMEA\n\nAPJ\n\nLong-term regional growth rate beyond five years\n\n2.5%\n\n1.5%\n\n2.0%\n\nDiscount rate\n\n9.5%\n\n9.5%\n\n10.5%\n\nAs at 31 March 2019, there were no indicators of impairment that suggested the carrying amounts of the Group’s long-lived assets are not recoverable. In order to assess the sensitivity in the assumptions made, the Directors have flexed the discount rate upward by thirty per cent of the above rates, and noted that this still did not give any indication of impairment.\n\n153",

In conjunction with the changes to reporting units, we reassigned goodwill between CGD and CMS based on their relative fair values on October 1, 2017.\n\nIn July 2017, we acquired Deltenna, a wireless infrastructure company specializing in the design and delivery of radio and antenna communication solutions. Deltenna’s operations were included in our CGD reporting unit upon its acquisition. On April 1, 2019, we reorganized our reporting structure to include Deltenna in our CMS reporting unit and reassigned $3.4 million of goodwill from CGD to CMS based upon its relative fair value. Since its acquisition, Deltenna’s sales, operating results, and cash flows have not been significant to our consolidated results. As such, reportable segment information has not been restated for this change in the composition of our reportable segments.\n\nWe complete our annual goodwill impairment test each year as of July 1 separately for our CTS, CGD and CMS reporting units.\n\nThe test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process. The first step of the test is performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including recorded goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment, if any, by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount. Any resulting impairment determined would be recorded in the current period.\n\nFor our 2019 impairment test, the estimated fair value of all three of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts. As such, there was no impairment of goodwill in 2019.\n\nSignificant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that are used in our impairment analysis.

Although we believe our underlying assumptions supporting these assessments are reasonable, if our forecasted sales and margin growth rates, timing of growth, or the discount rate vary from our forecasts, we may be required to perform interim analyses in fiscal 2020 that could expose us to material impairment charges in the future.\n\n107\n\nTotal\n\n",

            "GLOSSARY ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES – continued\n\nEBITDA: TORM defines EBITDA as earnings before financial income and expenses, depreciation, impairment, amortization and taxes. The computation of EBITDA refers to financial income and expenses which the Company deems to be equivalent to “interest” for purposes of presenting EBITDA. Financial expenses consist of interest on borrowings, losses on foreign exchange transactions and bank charges. Financial income consists of interest income and gains on foreign exchange transactions.\n\nEBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by Management and external users of financial statements, such as lenders, to assess TORM's operating performance as well as compliance with the financial covenants and restrictions contained in the Company's financing agreements. TORM believes that EBITDA assists Management and investors by increasing comparability of the Company's performance from period to period. This increased comparability is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects of interest, depreciation, impairment, amortization and taxes. These are items that could be affected by various changing financing methods and capital structure and which may significantly affect profit/(loss) between periods. Including EBITDA as a measure benefits investors in selecting between investment alternatives.\n\nEBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect profit/(loss), and these measures may vary among other companies and not be directly comparable.

            "Table of Contents\n\nOn June 7, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner upheld U.S. Treasury Department regulations requiring that related parties in a cost-sharing arrangement share expenses related to stock-based compensation in proportion to the economic activity of the parties. The ruling reversed the prior decision of the U.S. Tax Court. On November 12, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the plaintiff’s request for an en banc rehearing. Based on the appellate court’s ruling, the Company recorded a cumulative income tax expense of $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The plaintiff filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court on February 10, 2020, and the Company will continue to monitor developments in this matter.\n\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets were as follows (in thousands):\n\nDecember 31,\n\n2019\n\nDeferred tax assets:\n\nNet operating losses and credits\n\n$\n\n113,475 $\n\nFixed assets and intangible assets\n\n61,932\n\nAccruals and reserves\n\n75,133\n\nStock-based compensation\n\n8,615\n\nInventory\n\n429\n\nOther\n\n5,287\n\nTotal deferred tax assets\n\n264,871\n\nLess: valuation allowance\n\n(244,581)\n\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance\n\n20,290\n\nDeferred tax liabilities:\n\nAccruals and reserves\n\n(15,525)\n\nOther\n\n(914)\n\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n\n(16,439)\n\nNet deferred tax assets\n\n$\n\n3,851 $\n\nThe Company accounts for deferred taxes under ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”) which involves weighing positive and negative evidence concerning the realizability of the Company’s deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction. The Company evaluated its ability to realize the benefit of its net deferred tax assets and weighed all available positive and negative evidence both objective and subjective in nature. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the weight given to positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. Consideration was given to negative evidence such as: the duration and severity of losses in prior years, high seasonal revenue concentrations, increasing competitive pressures, and a challenging retail environment. Realization of the Company’s net deferred tax assets is dependent upon its generation of sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income change.\n\nThe Company recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the net amount that the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized.

            "\n\nThe duration of some of our FPSO contracts is the life of the relevant oil field or is subject to extension by the field operator or vessel charterer. If the oil field no longer produces oil or is abandoned or the contract term is not extended, we will no longer generate revenue under the related contract and will need to seek to redeploy affected vessels. FPSO contracts under which our FPSO units operate are subject to extensions beyond their initial term. The likelihood of these contracts being extended may be negatively affected by reductions in oil field reserves, low oil prices generally or other factors. If we are unable to promptly redeploy any affected vessels at rates at least equal to those under the contracts, if at all, our operating results will be harmed. Any potential redeployment may not be under long-term contracts, which may affect the stability of our cash flow and our ability to make cash distributions. FPSO units, in particular, are specialized vessels that have very limited alternative uses and high fixed costs. In addition, FPSO units typically require substantial capital investments prior to being redeployed to a new field and production service agreement. Any idle time prior to the commencement of a new contract or our inability to redeploy the vessels at acceptable rates may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\n\nWe do not control access to cash flow generated by our investments in equity-accounted joint ventures. We do not have control over the operations of, nor do we have any legal claim to the revenue and expenses of our investments in, our equity-accounted joint ventures.

During 2018, professional fees included amounts relating to the tax treatment dispute relating to the lease of three LNG carriers (or the RasGas II LNG Carriers) in Teekay LNG's 70%-owned consolidated subsidiary Teekay Nakilat Corporation (or the RasGas II Joint Venture) and claims against a Norway-based marine transportation company, I.M. Skaugen SE, for damages and losses for Teekay LNG's seven multi-gas carriers previously on charter to them; and\n\n\n\nan increase of $3.2 million due to the Polar Spirit being off-hire for 35 days in 2018 primarily due to an incident investigation involving a collision with a small vessel and repositioning to other charters;\n\npartially offset by\n\n\n\na decrease of $9.1 million due to the Madrid Spirit and Galicia Spirit being off-hire for 82 days and 38 days in 2019, respectively, and the impact of the depreciation of the Euro on Teekay LNG's Euro-denominated revenue and Euro-denominated operating expenses, partially offset by the Catalunya Spirit being off-hire for 28 days in 2018 for a scheduled dry docking; and\n\n\n\na decrease of $3.5 million due to decrease in operating expenses passed through to the charterer and due to declining revenue recognition for charter contracts accounted for as direct financing leases for the Tangguh Sago and Tangguh Hiri in 2019.\n\n",

The rates presented by Clarksons Shipping were significantly influenced by the spike in the Suezmaxtanker rates in the fourth quarter of both 2019 and 2018. Our average TCE was also positively impacted by the increased tanker rates towards the end of 2019, but not to the same extentas the rates reported by Clarksons Shipping. We expect this spike to materialize to a larger extent in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the rates reported by Clarksons Shipping.As a result of i) and ii) net voyage revenues increased by 41.5% from $124.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to $175.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.Voyage expenses decreased to $141.8 million from $165.0 million, or 14.1%. The decrease in voyage expenses was primarily due to a decrease in vessel calendar days asdiscussed above.Vessel operating expenses decreased by $14.4 million, or 17.9%, from $80.4 million in 2018 to $66.0 million in 2019. This was primarily due to the decrease in our fleet as discussedabove. In cooperation with our technical managers we maintain our focus on keeping the fleet in top technical condition whilst keeping costs low.No impairment loss on vessels has been recorded in 2019 compared to a loss of $2.2 million recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018.General and administrative expenses increased $0.7 million, or 5.9%, from $12.7 million in 2018 to $13.5 million in 2019.Depreciation expenses increased by $3.3 million, or 5.4%, from $60.7 million in 2018 to $64.0 million in 2019. The increase is primarily due to the full-year effect of the threevessels added to the fleet in the latter part of 2018.Interest expenses increased by $3.8 million, or 11.1%, from $34.5 million in 2018 to $38.4 million in 2019. The increase is mainly due to the full year-effect of the loans associatedwith the three vessels added to the fleet in latter part of 2018 and a non-cash expense of about $1.7 million related to the remaining borrowing cost under the Credit Facility that wasrepaid on February 12, 2019.Other financial expenses decreased by $10.6, or 71.4%, from $14.8 million in 2018 to $4.2 million in 2019 mainly due an expense related to fair value change of $3.2 million forInvestment Securities, offset by the cancellation of the Backstop facility in 2018 and expense of the associated fees of $13.4 million.Please see Item 5.

Volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was flat in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior-year period. This result reflected merchandising changes and price elasticity-related declines in certain brands, as well as isolated production challenges, partially offset by the continued benefit from momentum and innovation successes in the snacks businesses. Price/ mix was flat compared to the prior year as unfavorable mix, coupled with increases in brand building investments with retailers were offset by the impact of higher pricing. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC, which was completed in October 2017, contributed $41.3 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 results included $115.9 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $156.4 million of net sales related to this divested business.\n\nRefrigerated & Frozen net sales for fiscal 2019 were $2.80 billion, an increase of $51.0 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 1% increase in volume compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales volumes was a result of innovation across multiple brands, which was partially offset by the effects of reduced merchandising spend and the impact of a recall during the fourth quarter. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2018, as continued delivery of top-line accretive innovation in several brands was partially offset by brand building investments with retailers. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business, which was completed in February 2018, contributed $25.7 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition.\n\nInternational net sales for fiscal 2019 were $793.4 million, a decrease of $50.1 million, or 6%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 2% increase in volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, a 4% decrease due to foreign exchange rates, and a 2% increase in price/mix, in each case compared to fiscal 2018. The volume and price/ mix increases for fiscal 2019 were driven by growth in the Canadian snacks and frozen businesses. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $3.7 million to International net sales for fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 included $4.1 million of net sales related to our Del Monte® processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada, which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $48.9 million of net sales related to this divested business. In addition, fiscal 2019 and 2018 results included $17.1 million and $24.5 million, respectively, related to our divested Wesson® oil business.\n\nFoodservice net sales for fiscal 2019 were $934.2 million, a decrease of $120.6 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 14% decrease in volume, excluding divestitures. The decline in volume reflected the continued execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy and the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Price/mix increased 5% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in price/mix for fiscal 2019 reflected favorable product and customer mix, the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing, and the execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy. Fiscal 2019 included $34.2 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $53.4 million of net sales related to this divested business. Net sales declined by approximately 7% in fiscal 2019 due to the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility.\n\nPinnacle Foods net sales for fiscal 2019 (reflecting 213 days of Conagra Brands ownership) were $1.73 billion.

During 2019, we also sold the first 12 teams for the Call of Duty League, which began its first season in January 2020.\n\nInternational Sales\n\nInternational sales are a fundamental part of our business. An important element of our international strategy is to develop\n\ncontent that is specifically directed toward local cultures and customs. Net revenues from international sales accounted for approximately 54%, 54%, and 55% of our total consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The majority of our net revenues from foreign countries are generated by consumers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business, including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changes in local economies. Accordingly, our future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in local economies.\n\nOperating Metrics\n\nThe following operating metrics are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business. The key drivers of\n\nchanges in our operating metrics are presented in the order of significance.\n\nNet bookings and In-game net bookings\n\nWe monitor net bookings as a key operating metric in evaluating the performance of our business because it enables an analysis of performance based on the timing of actual transactions with our customers and provides more timely indication of trends in our operating results. Net bookings is the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period, and includes license fees, merchandise, and publisher incentives, among others. Net bookings is equal to net revenues excluding the impact from deferrals. In-game net bookings primarily includes the net amount of downloadable content and microtransactions sold during the period, and is equal to in-game net revenues excluding the impact from deferrals.\n\nNet bookings and in-game net bookings were as follows (amounts in millions):\n\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nIncrease (Decrease)\n\nNet bookings\n\n$\n\n6,388\n\n$\n\n7,262\n\n$\n\nIn-game net bookings\n\n$\n\n3,366\n\n$\n\n4,203\n\n$\n\nNet bookings\n\nThe decrease in net bookings for 2019, as compared to 2018, was primarily due to:\n\n\n\na $572 million decrease in Blizzard net bookings primarily driven by (1) lower net bookings from Hearthstone and (2) overall lower net bookings from World of Warcraft expansion and in-game content sales, primarily due to World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth, which was released in August 2018, with no comparable release in 2019 (although net bookings from subscriptions increased due to the release of World of Warcraft Classic in August 2019);\n\n\n\na $239 million decrease in Activision net bookings primarily driven by (1) lower net bookings from the Destiny franchise (reflecting our sale of the publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie in December 2018) and (2) lower net bookings from Call of Duty franchise catalog titles, partially offset by net bookings from Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled, and Call of Duty: Mobile, which were new releases in March 2019, June 2019, and October 2019, respectively; and\n\n33\n\n33\n\n",

The increase is primarily due to the full-year effect of the threevessels added to the fleet in the latter part of 2018.Interest expenses increased by $3.8 million, or 11.1%, from $34.5 million in 2018 to $38.4 million in 2019. The increase is mainly due to the full year-effect of the loans associatedwith the three vessels added to the fleet in latter part of 2018 and a non-cash expense of about $1.7 million related to the remaining borrowing cost under the Credit Facility that wasrepaid on February 12, 2019.Other financial expenses decreased by $10.6, or 71.4%, from $14.8 million in 2018 to $4.2 million in 2019 mainly due an expense related to fair value change of $3.2 million forInvestment Securities, offset by the cancellation of the Backstop facility in 2018 and expense of the associated fees of $13.4 million.Please see Item 5.

            "GLOSSARY ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES – continued\n\nEBITDA: TORM defines EBITDA as earnings before financial income and expenses, depreciation, impairment, amortization and taxes. The computation of EBITDA refers to financial income and expenses which the Company deems to be equivalent to “interest” for purposes of presenting EBITDA. Financial expenses consist of interest on borrowings, losses on foreign exchange transactions and bank charges. Financial income consists of interest income and gains on foreign exchange transactions.\n\nEBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by Management and external users of financial statements, such as lenders, to assess TORM's operating performance as well as compliance with the financial covenants and restrictions contained in the Company's financing agreements. TORM believes that EBITDA assists Management and investors by increasing comparability of the Company's performance from period to period. This increased comparability is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects of interest, depreciation, impairment, amortization and taxes. These are items that could be affected by various changing financing methods and capital structure and which may significantly affect profit/(loss) between periods. Including EBITDA as a measure benefits investors in selecting between investment alternatives.\n\nEBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect profit/(loss), and these measures may vary among other companies and not be directly comparable.

During 2018, professional fees included amounts relating to the tax treatment dispute relating to the lease of three LNG carriers (or the RasGas II LNG Carriers) in Teekay LNG's 70%-owned consolidated subsidiary Teekay Nakilat Corporation (or the RasGas II Joint Venture) and claims against a Norway-based marine transportation company, I.M. Skaugen SE, for damages and losses for Teekay LNG's seven multi-gas carriers previously on charter to them; and\n\n\n\nan increase of $3.2 million due to the Polar Spirit being off-hire for 35 days in 2018 primarily due to an incident investigation involving a collision with a small vessel and repositioning to other charters;\n\npartially offset by\n\n\n\na decrease of $9.1 million due to the Madrid Spirit and Galicia Spirit being off-hire for 82 days and 38 days in 2019, respectively, and the impact of the depreciation of the Euro on Teekay LNG's Euro-denominated revenue and Euro-denominated operating expenses, partially offset by the Catalunya Spirit being off-hire for 28 days in 2018 for a scheduled dry docking; and\n\n\n\na decrease of $3.5 million due to decrease in operating expenses passed through to the charterer and due to declining revenue recognition for charter contracts accounted for as direct financing leases for the Tangguh Sago and Tangguh Hiri in 2019.\n\n"

The Group also monitors the level of expected cash inflows on trade receivables and contract assets together with expected cash outflows on trade and other payables through rolling forecasts. This excludes the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted.\n\nConcentrations arise when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographical region, or have economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions. Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the Group’s performance to developments affecting a particular industry.\n\nIn order to avoid excessive concentrations of risk, the Group’s internal policies and procedures include specific guidelines to focus on maintaining a diversified portfolio. Identified concentrations of credit risks are controlled and managed accordingly.\n\nThe Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities consist of trade payables expected to be settled within three months. At 30 June 2019, the carrying amount and contractual cash flows is $25,153,000 (2018: $33,978,000).\n\niSelect Annual Report 2019\n\nValuation and disclosure within fair value hierarchy\n\nThe financial instruments included in the statement of financial position are measured either at fair value or their carrying value approximates fair value, with the exception of the trail commission asset and borrowings, which are held at amortised cost.\n\nTo determine fair value we use both observable and unobservable inputs. We classify inputs used in the valuation of our financial instruments according to a three level hierarchy as shown below:\n\nLevel 1 – quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n\nLevel 2 – valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable; and\n\nLevel 3 – valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.\n\nThe fair values of all financial assets and liabilities approximates their carrying amounts shown in the statement of financial position.\n\nFor financial instruments not quoted in the active markets, the Group used valuation techniques such as present value techniques (which include lapse and mortality rates, commission terms, premium increases and credit risk), comparison to similar instruments for which market observable prices exist, and other relevant models used by market participants. These valuation techniques use both observable and unobservable market inputs.\n\nSensitivity of trail commission asset\n\nA combined premium price decrease of 1% and termination rate increase of 1% would have the effect of reducing the carrying value by $10,434,000 (2018: $9,838,000). A combined premium price increase of 1% and termination rate decrease of 1% would have the effect of increasing the carrying value by $9,627,000 (2018: $8,946,000). Individually, the effects of these inputs would not give rise to any additional amount greater than those stated."

The majority of our shell eggs are sold at independently quoted wholesale market prices for shell eggs or formulas related to our costs of production which include the cost of corn and soybean meal. The following table shows our net income (loss), gross profit, net average shell egg selling price, the average Urner Barry wholesale large shell egg prices in the southeast region, and feed cost per dozen produced for each of our three most recent fiscal years.\n\nFiscal Year ended\n\nJune 1, 2019\n\nJune 2, 2018\n\nJune 3, 2017\n\nNet income (loss) attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. - (in thousands) Gross profit (in thousands) Net average shell egg selling price (rounded) Average Urner Barry Spot Egg Market Quotations 1 Feed cost per dozen produced\n\n$\n\n54,229 $ 222,859 1.27 1.23 0.415\n\n125,932 $ 361,046 1.40 1.49 0.394\n\n(74,278) 45,550 1.01 0.85 0.399\n\n1- Average Thursday price for the large market (i.e. generic shell eggs) in the southeastern region\n\nThe shell egg industry has historically been subject to periods of high profitability followed by periods of significant loss. The periods of high profitability have often reflected increased consumer demand relative to supply while the periods of significant loss have often reflected excess supply for the then prevailing consumer demand. Historically, demand for shell eggs increases in line with overall population growth. As reflected above, our operating results fluctuate with changes in the spot egg market quote and feed costs. The net average shell egg selling price is the blended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs, including non-graded shell egg sales, breaking stock and undergrades. In fiscal 2017, our net average selling price and dozens sold decreased over the previous fiscal year primarily due to the oversupply of eggs resulting from the repopulation of the national flock of laying hens to levels exceeding the flock size prior to the avian influenza outbreak in 2015, along with a reduced demand for egg products. In fiscal 2018, strong demand resulted in an increase in our average selling price and dozens sold, and feed costs decreased over prior years. Fiscal 2019 saw an increasing U.S. flock size result in oversupply of eggs, particularly in the last half of the fiscal year. This resulted in decreased gross profit and net income for fiscal 2019.\n\n24\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFiscal Year Ended June 1, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 2, 2018\n\nNET SALES\n\nNet sales for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019 were $1,361.2 million, a decrease of $141.7 million, or 9.4%, from net sales of $1,502.9 million for fiscal 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower selling prices for non-specialty eggs in fiscal 2019 due to the oversupply of eggs, particularly in the last half of the fiscal year, contrasted with fiscal 2018 in which we experienced strong demand resulting in higher prices for non-specialty eggs.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, shell egg sales made up approximately 97% of our net sales. Total dozens sold in fiscal 2019 were 1,038.9 million, an increase of 1.2 million dozen, or 0.1%, compared to 1,037.7 million sold in fiscal 2018 resulting in an increase in net sales of $1.7 million for fiscal 2019 compared with the prior year.\n\nNet average selling price of shell eggs decreased from $1.397 per dozen for fiscal 2018 to $1.265 per dozen for fiscal 2019, a decrease of $0.132 per dozen, or 9.4%, primarily reflecting an abundance of eggs in the market. The decrease in sales price in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2018 resulted in a corresponding decrease in net sales of approximately $137.1 million. Our operating results are significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices, which are outside of our control. Small changes in production or demand levels can have a large effect on shell egg prices.\n\nEgg products accounted for approximately 3% of our net sales. These revenues were $41.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019 compared with $43.5 million for the fiscal 2018.\n\nThe table below represents an analysis of our non-specialty and specialty, as well as co-pack specialty, shell egg sales.

The additions for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019 and 2018 are primarily related to the impacts of the Tax Act and taxation of certain intercompany transactions. The additions for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 are primarily related to certain non-U.S. net operating loss carry forwards, previously offset with a valuation allowance, that can no longer be recognized due to an internal restructuring. The reductions from settlements with taxing authorities for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 are primarily related to the settlement of a U.S. audit.\n\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax\n\nexpense. The Company’s accrued interest and penalties were approximately $18.9 million and $20.4 million as of August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company recognized interest and penalties of approximately $(1.5) million, $(6.7) million and $5.2 million during the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\nIt is reasonably possible that the August 31, 2019 unrecognized tax benefits could decrease during the next\n\n12 months by $5.8 million, primarily related to a state settlement.\n\n",

All of the NOL carryforward was incurred subsequent to the enactment of the TCJA and therefore has an indefinite carryforward period. The Company has significant deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to property, plant and equipment, which are expected to reverse and allow for the full utilization of the NOL carryforward. As such, the Company has not recorded a valuation allowance related to the NOL carryforward. Also included in the deferred tax assets are North Carolina Investing in Business Property Credit and North Carolina Jobs Credits totaling $4.9 million, as well as Georgia Job Tax Credits totaling $2.6 million. The North Carolina Investing in Business Property Credit provides a 7% investment tax credit for property located in a North Carolina development area, the North Carolina Creating Jobs Credit provides a tax credit for increased employment in North Carolina, and the Georgia Job Tax Credit provides a tax credit for creation and retention of qualifying jobs in Georgia. It is management’s opinion that the majority of the North Carolina and Georgia income tax credits will not be utilized before they expire, and a $5.6 million valuation allowance has been recorded as of October 31, 2019. The North Carolina credits began to expire during fiscal 2018, and the remaining credits expire between fiscal years 2020 and 2023.\n\n58\n\n2017\n\n117,611 11,024 128,635\n\n15,452 1,804 (1,106) 16,150 144,785\n\n2018\n\n88,351 1,751 90,102\n\n7,814 2,862 8,280 12,235 654 (11,017) 6,481 27,309 62,793",

Cloud infrastructure costs include $9.5million of hosting related costs that were recorded in cost of services revenue in fiscal year 2018. The treatment of these hosting related costs is consistent with thetreatment of the related revenue in each fiscal year.We anticipate higher cost of license and subscription revenue as we continue to invest in our cloud operations to increase operational efficiency and scalewhile growing our customer base.Cost of maintenance revenue increased by $1.7 million primarily due to the increase in personnel required to support our term and perpetual licensecustomers.Our cost of services revenue would have increased if cloud infrastructure costs totaling $9.5 million were not reclassified to cost of license and subscriptionrevenue, consistent with the treatment of the related revenue. Excluding the impact of this reclassification, third-party consultants billable to customers primarilyfor InsuranceNow implementation engagements increased by $3.2 million and personnel expenses related to new and existing employees increased by $2.8million.We had 781 professional service employees and 198 technical support and licensing operations employees at July 31, 2019 compared to 838 professionalservices employees and 121 technical support and licensing operations employees at July 31, 2018."

Contract liabilities (formerly referred to as customer advances prior to the adoption of ASC 606) include advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized. Contract assets and contract liabilities were as follows (in thousands):\n\nSeptember 30, 2019\n\nOctober 1, 2018\n\nContract assets Contract liabilities\n\n$ $\n\n349,559 46,170\n\n$ $\n\n272,210 70,127\n\nContract assets increased $77.3 million during the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, due to the recognition of revenue related to the satisfaction or partial satisfaction of performance obligations during the twelve months ended September 30, 2019 for which we have not yet billed. There were no significant impairment losses related to our contract assets during the twelve months ended September 30, 2019.\n\nContract liabilities decreased $24.0 million during the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, due to revenue recognition in excess of payments received on these performance obligations. During the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2019, we recognized $62.4 million of our contract liabilities at October 1, 2018 as revenue. We expect our contract liabilities to be recognized as revenue over the next twelve months.\n\nNOTE 7—ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE\n\nThe components of accounts receivable are as follows (in thousands):\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nAccounts receivable\n\nBilled Unbilled\n\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\n\nTotal accounts receivable\n\nLess estimated amounts not currently due\n\nCurrent accounts receivable\n\n$\n\n$\n\n156,948 242,877 (1,324) 398,501 (6,134) 126,014 $ 392,367\n\n127,406 — (1,392) 126,014 —\n\n$\n\nAmounts billed include $60.3 million and $80.5 million due on U.S. federal government contracts at September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As further described in Note 2, effective October 1, 2018, the component of accounts receivable that consisted of unbilled contract receivables as reported under ASC 605 has been reclassified as contract assets under ASC 606.\n\nIn our normal course of business, we may sell trade receivables to financial institutions as a cash management technique. We do not retain financial or legal obligations for these receivables that would result in material losses. Our ongoing involvement is limited to the remittance of customer payments to the financial institutions with respect to the sold trade receivables; therefore, our sold trade receivables are not included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet in any period presented. As of September 30, 2019, we sold $31.1 million of outstanding trade receivables to financial institutions.\n\n104",
            "The Company’s software license arrangements with its customers often include multiple promises to transfer licensed software products and services. Determining whether the products and/or services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment.\n\nThe Company’s SaaS and PaaS arrangements may include variable consideration in the form of usage-based fees. If the arrangement that includes variable consideration in the form of usage-based fees does not meet the allocation exception for variable consideration, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration at the outset of the arrangement using either the expected value or most likely amount method, depending on the specifics of each arrangement. These estimates are constrained to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of incremental revenue will not occur and are updated each reporting period as additional information becomes available.\n\nJudgment is used in determining: (1) whether the financing component in a software license agreement is significant and, if so, (2) the discount rate used in calculating the significant financing component. The Company assesses the significance of the financing component based on the ratio of license fees paid over time to total license fees. If determined to be significant, the financing component is calculated using a rate that discounts the license fees to the cash selling price.\n\nJudgment is also used in assessing whether the extension of payment terms in a software license arrangement results in variable consideration and, if so, the amount to be included in the transaction price. The Company applies the portfolio approach to estimating the amount of variable consideration in these arrangements using the most likely amount method that is based on the Company’s historical collection experience under similar arrangements.\n\nSignificant judgment is required to determine the SSP for each performance obligation, the amount allocated to each performance obligation and whether it depicts the amount that the Company expects to receive in exchange for the related product and/or service. As the selling prices of the Company’s software licenses are highly variable, the Company estimates SSP of its software licenses using the residual approach when the software license is sold with other services and observable SSPs exist for the other services. The Company uses a range of amounts to estimate SSP for maintenance and services. These ranges are based on stand-alone sales and vary based on the type of service and geographic region. If the SSP of a performance obligation is not directly observable, the Company will maximize observable inputs to determine its SSP.\n\nContract Balances\n\nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. The Company records an accrued receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing and the Company’s right to consideration only requires the passage of time, or deferred revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing.\n\nTotal receivables represent amounts billed and amounts earned that are to be billed in the future (i.e., accrued receivables). Included in accrued receivables are services and SaaS and PaaS revenues earned in the current period but billed in the following period and amounts due under multi-year software license arrangements with extended payment terms for which the Company has an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment subsequent to invoicing.\n\nTotal receivables, net is comprised of the following (in thousands):\n\nDecember 31,\n\nBilled receivables Allowance for doubtful accounts\n\nBilled receivables, net\n\nAccrued receivables Significant financing component\n\nTotal accrued receivables, net Less: current accrued receivables Less: current significant financing component\n\nTotal long-term accrued receivables, net\n\n$\n\n2019 213,654 $ (5,149 ) 208,505 399,302 (35,569 ) 363,733 161,714 (11,022 ) 213,041 572,238 $\n\n2018 239,275 (3,912 ) 235,363 336,858 (35,029 ) 301,829 123,053 (10,234 ) 189,010 537,192\n\nTotal receivables, net\n\n$\n\nNo customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated receivables balance as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\n",
            "82\n\nFinancials – Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nNote F1, cont’d.\n\nImpairment of trade receivables and contract assets Trade receivables and contract assets are assessed for impairment under a unified model. The Company has determined that credit risk largely depends on both the risk in the country where the customer resides (e.g. ability to make cross border payments) as well as the payment pattern of the customer. There- fore, expected credit losses (ECLs) are calculated using a provision matrix that specifies a fixed rate depending both on the number of days past due and the country risk rating. The country risk ratings depends on the ratings used by all Export Credit Agencies within the OECD. The rates defined in the provision matrix are based on historical loss patterns for that grouping of customers. These rates are adjusted for current conditions as well as management expec- tations for changes to political risks and payment patterns in the future. The provision rates are higher on high risk countries compared to low risk countries and also higher on amounts that remain unpaid for longer periods of time. There were no significant changes to the model during the year.\n\nTrade receivables and contract assets together amounted to SEK 55,240 (64,350) million as of December 31, 2019. Provisions for expected credit losses on trade receivables and contract assets amounted to SEK 2,983 (4,123) million as of December 31, 2019. The allowance decreased in 2019 due to improvement in cash collection resulting in significant reduction of total past due invoices. The Company’s write-offs have historically been low. During the year SEK 382 (890) million were written off due to the Company having no reasonable expectation of collection. Of these write-offs, SEK 0 (61) million are still subject to enforcement.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, the total amount payable to the Company under customer finance credits was SEK 5,924 (4,247) million. The carrying value of these assets was SEK 3,756 (2,883) million as of December 31, 2019, which represents the maximum exposure to credit risk on these assets. Customer finance is arranged for infrastructure projects in different geographic markets. As of December 31, 2019, there were a total of 80 (94) customer finance arrangements originated by or guaranteed by the Company. The five largest facilities represented 69% (62%) of the customer finance exposure in 2019. As of December 31, 2019, Middle East and Africa made up 49% (57%) of the oustanding exposure while South East Asia, Oceania and India made up 29% (15%). As of December 31, 2019, the Company also had unutilized customer finance commitments of SEK 25,854 (30,270) million.\n\nSecurity arrangements for customer finance facilities may include pledges of equipment, pledges of certain assets belonging to the borrower and pledges of shares in the operating company. If available, third-party risk coverage is, as a rule, arranged. “Third-party risk coverage” means that a financial payment guarantee covering the credit risk has been issued by a bank, an export credit agency or an insurance company. All such institutions have been rated at least investment grade. A credit risk transfer under a sub-participation arrange- ment with a bank can also be arranged. In this case the entire credit risk and the funding is taken care of by the bank for the part that they cover.\n\nInformation about financial guarantees related to customer finance is\n\nincluded in note D2, “Contingent liabilities.”\n\nThe table below summarizes the Company’s outstanding customer finance\n\nas of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\nMovements in allowances for impairment of trade receivables and contract assets\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nOutstanding customer finance credit risk exposure 1)\n\nOpening balance Decrease (–)/increase (+) in allowance Write-offs Translation difference Closing balance 1)\n\n1) Of which SEK 0 (15) million relates to contract assets.\n\n4,123 –737 –382 –21\n\n2,983\n\n4,575 420 –890 18\n\n4,123\n\nFair value of customer finance credits Financial guarantees for third-parties Accrued interest\n\nMaximum exposure to credit risk Less third-party risk coverage\n\n2019\n\n3,756 24 14\n\n3,794 –309\n\n2018\n\n2,883 42 21\n\n2,946 –331\n\nThe Company’s risk exposure, less third-party risk coverage\n\n3,485\n\n2,615\n\nThe distribution of trade receivables and contract assets closely follows the distribution of the Company’s sales, see note B1, “Segment information.” The ten largest customers represented 49% (53%) of the total trade receivables and contract assets in 2019.\n\nAging analysis of gross values by risk category at December 31, 2019\n\nDays past due\n\n1–90\n\n91–180\n\n181–360\n\n>360\n\nCountry risk: Low Country risk: Medium Country risk: High\n\n1,347 891 583\n\n125 725 365\n\n127 600 217\n\n313 819 1,315\n\nTotal past due\n\n2,821\n\n1,215\n\n944\n\n2,447\n\nCustomer finance credit risk All major commitments to finance customers are made only after approval in accordance with the work procedure for the Board of Directors and according to the established credit approval process.\n\nTotal\n\n1,912 3,035 2,480\n\n7,427\n\n1) This table has been adjusted to show the maximum exposure to credit risk.\n\nFair value assessment of customer finance credits Customer finance risk exposures are held at fair value and are classified as Level 3 on the fair value hierarchy. The Credit Asset Management Team within Ericsson Credit AB, reporting to Head of Group Treasury and Customer Finance, has established a process with respect to measurement of fair values. The quarterly credit review uses an internal model to determine a commercial rating for each credit and for calculation of the fair value. The model is based on exter- nal credit rating, political/country rating and bank pricing. Regular monitoring of customer behavior is also a part of the internal assessment. Revaluation of customer finance amounted to a net negative impact in the income statement of SEK 804 (1,073) million in 2019, of which SEK 804 (1,073) million is related to credits held as of December 31, 2019. This effect is presented within selling and administrative expenses and was mainly related to India and the Middle East, especially Iran and Iraq.\n\nPrior to the approval of new facilities reported as customer finance, an internal credit risk assessment is conducted in order to assess the credit rating of each transaction for political and commercial risk. The credit risk analysis is made by using an assessment tool, where the political risk rating is identical to the rating used by all Export Credit Agencies within the OECD. The commercial risk is assessed by analyzing a large number of parameters, which may affect the level of the future commercial credit risk exposure. The output from the assessment tool for the credit rating also includes an internal pricing of the risk. This is expressed as a risk margin per annum over funding cost."

As of December 31, 2019, and 2018, we recorded deferred tax assets related to certain U.S. state and non-U.S. income tax loss carryforwards of $4,724 and $4,647, respectively, and U.S. and non- U.S. tax credits of $15,964 and $16,909, respectively. The deferred tax assets expire in various years primarily between 2021 and 2039.\n\nGenerally, we assess if it is more-likely-than-not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized during the available carry-forward periods. As a result, we have determined that valuation allowances of $8,011 and $8,274 should be provided for certain deferred tax assets at December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the valuation allowances relate to certain U.S. state and non-U.S. loss carry-forwards and certain U.S. state tax credits that management does not anticipate will be utilized.\n\nNo valuation allowance was recorded in 2019 against the U.S. federal foreign tax credit carryforwards of $5,785, which expire in varying amounts between 2023 and 2029 as well as the research and development tax credits of $7,495, which expire in varying amounts between 2021 and 2039. We assessed the anticipated realization of those tax credits utilizing future taxable income projections. Based on those projections, management believes it is more-likely-than-not that we will realize the benefits of these credit carryforwards.\n\nThe following table reconciles taxes at the U.S. federal statutory rate to the effective income tax rate:\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nTaxes at the U.S. statutory rate\n\n21.0 %\n\n21.0 %\n\nState income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit\n\n0.4 %\n\n1.2 %\n\nNon-U.S. earnings taxed at rates different than the U.S. statutory rate\n\n1.3 %\n\n0.8 %\n\nForeign source earnings, net of associated foreign tax credits\n\n0.3 %\n\n4.1 %\n\nBenefit of tax credits\n\n(1.5)%\n\n(0.9)%\n\nNon-deductible expenses\n\n4.1 %\n\n1.3 %\n\nStock compensation - excess tax benefits\n\n(1.1)%\n\n(0.9)%\n\nAdjustment to valuation allowances\n\n(0.4)%\n\n(0.6)%\n\nOther changes in tax laws and rates\n\n0.1 %\n\n(6.1)%\n\nChange in unrecognized tax benefits\n\n3.3 %\n\n(1.7)%\n\nImpacts of unremitted foreign earnings\n\n1.3 %\n\n1.1 %\n\nImpacts related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\n\n— %\n\n(0.6)%\n\nOther\n\n(0.7)%\n\n1.2 %\n\nEffective income tax rate\n\n28.1 %\n\n19.9 %\n\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. We recognized a provisional amount of $18,001 as an additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017. This amount included $11,734 related to the mandatory deemed one-time transition tax and $6,267 related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nOn December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\") was issued to address the application of U.S.",

A valuation allowance of $31.4 million and $28.5 million remained as of July 31, 2019 and 2018,respectively. The increase of $2.9 million in the valuation allowance in the current fiscal year relates primarily to net operating losses and income tax creditsincurred in certain tax jurisdictions for which no tax benefit was recognized.84\n\nTable of Contents"

As a result of the Act, we recognized an estimated expense of $11.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, of which $9.2 million related to the write- down of deferred tax assets and $2.7 million related to tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings. We calculated our best estimate of the impact of the Act in our 2017 year-end income tax provision in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which was issued to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed to finalize the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act. Additional work to complete a more detailed analysis of historical foreign earnings, as well as the full impact relating to the write-down of deferred tax assets, was completed in the third quarter of 2018 and resulted in a tax benefit of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, non-current deferred taxes related to our investments and our defined benefit pension plan reflect deferred taxes on the net unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments and deferred taxes on unrealized losses in our pension plan. The net change in non-current deferred taxes associated with these items, which resulted in a deferred tax benefit of $0.4 million and $2.8 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, was recorded as an adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss), presented in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\n\n2018\n\n$6,609\n\n2,850\n\n1,122\n\n4,779\n\n3,069\n\n326\n\n5,538\n\n3,097\n\n8,164\n\n17,495\n\n—\n\n—\n\n(5,816)\n\n47,233\n\n(3,515)\n\n(6,531)\n\n—\n\n—\n\n(10,046)\n\n$37,187\n\nFinancial Results 71",

All of the NOL carryforward was incurred subsequent to the enactment of the TCJA and therefore has an indefinite carryforward period. The Company has significant deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to property, plant and equipment, which are expected to reverse and allow for the full utilization of the NOL carryforward. As such, the Company has not recorded a valuation allowance related to the NOL carryforward. Also included in the deferred tax assets are North Carolina Investing in Business Property Credit and North Carolina Jobs Credits totaling $4.9 million, as well as Georgia Job Tax Credits totaling $2.6 million. The North Carolina Investing in Business Property Credit provides a 7% investment tax credit for property located in a North Carolina development area, the North Carolina Creating Jobs Credit provides a tax credit for increased employment in North Carolina, and the Georgia Job Tax Credit provides a tax credit for creation and retention of qualifying jobs in Georgia. It is management’s opinion that the majority of the North Carolina and Georgia income tax credits will not be utilized before they expire, and a $5.6 million valuation allowance has been recorded as of October 31, 2019. The North Carolina credits began to expire during fiscal 2018, and the remaining credits expire between fiscal years 2020 and 2023.\n\n58\n\n2017\n\n117,611 11,024 128,635\n\n15,452 1,804 (1,106) 16,150 144,785\n\n2018\n\n88,351 1,751 90,102\n\n7,814 2,862 8,280 12,235 654 (11,017) 6,481 27,309 62,793",

The net increase in the total valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 is primarily related to the increase of a net operating loss carry forward due to a release of a non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefit and the increase of deferred tax assets in sites with existing valuation allowances. The decrease in domestic federal and state tax credits is primarily related to the utilization of tax credits against the one-time transition tax.\n\nAs of August 31, 2019, the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the remaining earnings from its foreign\n\nsubsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not already been recorded. The accumulated earnings are the most significant component of the basis difference which is indefinitely reinvested."

Interest income increased due to higher interest rates. Other expense in the year ended December 31, 2018, was driven by foreign currency translation losses mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro. Other income in the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven mainly by foreign currency translation gains due to the depreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro.\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nEffective tax rate\n\n19.9%\n\nThe effective income tax rate in 2018 was 19.9% compared to 64.1% in the prior year. The tax rate in 2018 was favorably impacted by a discrete one-time rate change benefit related to the Tax Act resulting from the election of tax accounting method changes, partially offset by a one-time withholding tax on repatriation of earnings from one of our foreign subsidiaries that was completed during the year to enable the use of tax credits due to expire in 2018. The tax rate in 2017 was unfavorably impacted by the application of the Tax Act, driven by the remeasurement of the net deferred tax assets from 35% to 21% and the one-time mandatory transition tax on the historical earnings of foreign affiliates, which resulted in a net non-cash charge of $18,001.\n\nNet earnings were $46,532 or $1.39 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to earnings of $14,448 or $0.43 per diluted share in the comparable period of 2017.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $100,241 at December 31, 2019, and $100,933 at December 31, 2018, of which $98,309 and $96,762, respectively, were held outside the United States. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $692 was primarily driven by cash generated from operating activities of $64,405 and net proceeds from an increase in borrowings of long-term debt of $49,700, which were offset by the payment for the QTI acquisition of $73,906, capital expenditures of $21,733, treasury stock purchases of $11,746, dividends paid of $5,238, and taxes paid on behalf of equity award participants of $2,657. Total debt as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, was $99,700 and $50,000, respectively. Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, defined as long-term debt as a percentage of total debt and shareholders’ equity, was 19.7% at December 31, 2019, compared to 11.7% at December 31, 2018.\n\nWorking capital increased by $5,164 from December 31, 2018, to December 31, 2019, driven mainly by the decrease in accrued payroll and benefits due to lower short-term incentive compensation and the decrease in accounts payable, which were partially offset by an increase in operating lease obligations.\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $64,405 during the year ended December 31, 2019.

            "Advertising Costs: Advertising costs amounted to $278,057, $365,859, and $378,217, for the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, and are charged to expense when incurred.\n\nNet Income Per Share: Basic and diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and the weighted average number of dilutive shares outstanding, respectively.\n\nWeighted average common shares outstanding for the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were as follows:\n\nYear ended September 30, Net income Weighted average common shares Dilutive potential common shares Weighted average dilutive common shares outstanding Earnings per share:\n\n$\n\n2019\n\n4,566,156 $ 13,442,871 8,343 13,451,214\n\n2018 4,274,547 $ 13,429,232 23,628 13,452,860\n\nBasic Diluted\n\n$ $\n\n0.34 $ 0.34 $\n\n0.32 $ 0.32 $\n\nThere were 268,000 and 108,000 shares for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, that were excluded from the above calculation as they were considered antidilutive in nature. No shares were considered antidilutive for the year ended September 30, 2017.\n\nUse of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, related revenues and expenses and disclosure about contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Significant estimates include the rebates related to revenue recognition, stock based compensation and the valuation of inventory, long-lived assets, finite lived intangible assets and goodwill. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements: In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. There have been further amendments, including practical expedients, with the issuance of ASU 2018-01 in January 2018, ASU 2018-11 in July 2018 and ASU 2018-20 in December 2018. The amended guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those reporting periods, with early adoption permitted. The guidance will be applied on a modified retrospective basis with the earliest period presented. Based on the effective date, this guidance will apply beginning October 1, 2019. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have no impact to retained earnings or net income. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02 on October 1, 2019, we anticipate recording a right-of-use asset and an offsetting lease liability of approximately $2.3 to $2.9 million.\n\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 Intangibles-Goodwill, which offers amended guidance to simplify the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. A goodwill impairment will now be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This guidance is to be applied on a prospective basis effective for the Company’s interim and annual periods beginning after January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted for any impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. The Company does not believe the adoption of this ASU will have a material impact on our financial statements.\n\n36\n\n2017 3,847,839 13,532,375 128,431 13,660,806\n\n0.28 0.",

            "$800.0 million, cash dividends paid of $342.3 million, repayments of long-term debt of $242.3 million, and a net increase in short-term borrowings of $249.1 million.\n\nThe Company had cash and cash equivalents of $236.6 million at May 26, 2019 and $128.0 million at May 27, 2018, of which $144.8 million at May 26, 2019, and $121.6 million at May 27, 2018, was held in foreign countries. We believe that our foreign subsidiaries have invested or will invest any undistributed earnings indefinitely, or that any undistributed earnings will be remitted in a tax-neutral transaction, and, therefore, do not provide deferred taxes on the cumulative undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.\n\nOur preliminary estimate of capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 is approximately $400 million.\n\nManagement believes that existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, existing credit facilities, and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our repayment of debt, including any repayment of debt or refinancing of debt, working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months.\n\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\n\nWe use off-balance sheet arrangements (e.g., leases accounted for as operating leases) where sound business principles warrant their use. We also periodically enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. These are described further in \"Obligations and Commitments\" below.\n\nVariable Interest Entities Not Consolidated\n\nWe lease or leased certain office buildings from entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities. The lease agreements with these entities include fixed-price purchase options for the assets being leased. The lease agreements also contain contingent put options (the \"lease put options\") that allow or allowed the lessors to require us to purchase the buildings at the greater of original construction cost, or fair market value, without a lease agreement in place (the \"put price\") in certain limited circumstances. As a result of substantial impairment charges related to our divested Private Brands operations, these lease put options became exercisable. We are amortizing the difference between the put price and the estimated fair value (without a lease agreement in place) of the property over the remaining lease term within SG&A expenses. During fiscal 2018, we purchased two buildings that were subject to lease put options and recognized net losses totaling $48.2 million for the early exit of unfavorable lease contracts. During fiscal 2017, one of these lease agreements expired, and we reversed the applicable accrual and recognized a benefit of $6.7 million in SG&A expenses.\n\nAs of May 26, 2019 and May 27, 2018, there was one remaining leased building subject to a lease put option for which the put option price exceeded the estimated fair value of the property by $8.2 million, of which we had accrued $1.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively. This lease is accounted for as an operating lease, and accordingly, there are no material assets and liabilities, other than the accrued portion of the put price, associated with this entity included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of this entity. In making this determination, we have considered, among other items, the terms of the lease agreement, the expected remaining useful life of the asset leased, and the capital structure of the lessor entity.\n\nOBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS\n\nAs part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements, debt agreements, and unconditional purchase obligations (i.e., obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices, such as \"take-or-pay\" contracts). The unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in our normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available. Of these items, debt, notes payable, and capital lease obligations, which totaled $10.72 billion as of May 26, 2019, were recognized as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations, which totaled $1.75 billion as of May 26, 2019, were not recognized as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\n37\n\nA summary of our contractual obligations as of May 26, 2019, was as follows:\n\nPayments Due by Period (in millions)\n\nContractual Obligations Long-term debt . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Capital lease obligations . . . . . . . . . .\n\nTotal\n\n10,556.6\n\n165.4\n\n$\n\nLess than 1 Year\n\n— $\n\n20.6\n\n1-3 Years\n\n2,747.6\n\n41.0\n\n$\n\n3-5 Years\n\n2,287.0\n\n29.4\n\n$\n\nAfter 5 Years\n\n5,522.0\n\n74.4\n\nOperating lease obligations . . . . . . . .

The weighted-\n\naverage coupon interest rate of the long-term debt obligations outstanding as of May 26, 2019, was approximately 4.7%.\n\nAs of May 26, 2019, we had aggregate unfunded pension and postretirement benefit obligations totaling $131.7 million and $87.8 million, respectively. These amounts are not included in the table above as the unfunded obligations are remeasured each fiscal year, thereby resulting in our inability to accurately predict the ultimate amount and timing of any future required contributions to such plans. Based on current statutory requirements, we are not obligated to fund any amount to our qualified pension plans during the next twelve months. We estimate that we will make payments of approximately $14.2 million and $10.8 million over the next twelve months to fund our pension and postretirement plans, respectively.",
            "The amounts in the table below exclude $373 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax benefits as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement. See Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2019 Form 10-K for further discussion.

The principal balances of the 2041 Notes are reflected in the payment period in the table above based on the contractual maturity assuming no conversion. See Note 14 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2019 Form 10-K for additional information concerning the 2041 Notes and associated conversion features.\n\n(3) We may choose to apply existing tax credits, thereby reducing the actual cash payment. (4) Certain tax-related liabilities and post-retirement benefits classified as other non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet are included in the “More than 5 Years” category due to the uncertainty in the timing and amount of future payments. Additionally, the balance excludes contractual obligations recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as current liabilities.\n\nOperating Leases\n\nWe lease most of our administrative, R&D, and manufacturing facilities; regional sales/service offices; and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Certain of our facility leases for buildings located in Fremont and Livermore, California; Tualatin, Oregon; and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. In addition to amounts included in the table above, we have guaranteed residual values for certain of our Fremont and Livermore facility leases of up to $250 million. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2019 Form 10-K for further discussion.\n\nCapital Leases\n\nCapital leases reflect building and office equipment lease obligations. The amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations.\n\nPurchase Obligations\n\nPurchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor-consigned inventories. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at June 30, 2019, under these arrangements and others. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nDuring the December 2017 quarter, a one-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings, estimated at $991 million, was recognized associated with the December 2017 U.S. tax reform. In accordance with SAB 118, we finalized the amount of the transition tax during the period ended December 23, 2018. The final amount is $868.4 million. The Company elected\n\nContinues on next page (cid:2)\n\nLam Research Corporation 2019 10-K 37\n\n38\n\nto pay the one-time transition tax over a period of eight years with 8% of the transition tax to be paid each September 15 for years 2018 through 2022, and 15%, 20%, and 25%, respectively, to be paid each September 15 for years 2023 through 2025.\n\nLong-Term Debt\n\nIn June 2012, with the acquisition of Novellus, we assumed $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due May 2041. We pay cash interest on the 2041 Notes at an annual rate of 2.625%, on a semi-annual basis. The 2041 Notes may be converted, under certain circumstances, into our Common Stock.\n\nDuring the quarter-ended June 30, 2019, the market value of our Common Stock was greater than or equal to 130% of the 2041 Notes conversion prices for 20 or more trading days of the 30 consecutive trading days preceding the quarter end. As a result, the 2041 Notes are convertible at the option of the holder and are classified as current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for fiscal year 2019.\n\nOn March 12, 2015, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due March 15, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”) and $500 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due March 15, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”). We pay interest at an annual rate of 2.75% and 3.80%, respectively, on the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes, on a semi-annual basis on March 15 and September 15 of each year.\n\nOn June 7, 2016, we completed a public offering of $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due June 15, 2021, (the “2021 Notes”), together with the 2020 Notes, and 2021 Notes, the “Senior Notes”, and collectively with the Convertible Notes, the “Notes”). We pay interest at an annual rate of 2.80% on the 2021 Notes on a semi-annual basis on June 15 and December 15 of each year.\n\n",
            " See Note 19 \"Pension and Postretirement Benefits\" to the consolidated financial statements and \"Critical Accounting Estimates - Employment Related Benefits\" contained in this report for further discussion of our pension obligations and factors that could affect estimates of this liability.\n\nAs part of our ongoing operations, we also enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments only upon the occurrence of a future event (e.g., guarantees of debt or lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable to perform). In accordance with U.S. GAAP, such commercial commitments are not recognized as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of May 26, 2019, we had other commercial commitments totaling $5.3 million, of which $3.7 million expire in less than one year and $1.6 million expire in one to three years.\n\nIn addition to the other commercial commitments, as of May 26, 2019, we had $56.4 million of standby letters of credit issued on our behalf. These standby letters of credit are primarily related to our self-insured workers compensation programs and are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nIn certain limited situations, we will guarantee an obligation of an unconsolidated entity. We guarantee certain leases resulting from the divestiture of the JM Swank business completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. As of May 26, 2019, the remaining terms of these arrangements did not exceed four years and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was $1.2 million. In addition, we guarantee a lease resulting from an exited facility. As of May 26, 2019, the remaining term of this arrangement did not exceed eight years and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was $19.1 million.\n\nWe also guarantee an obligation of the Lamb Weston business pursuant to a guarantee arrangement that existed prior to the Spinoff and remained in place following completion of the Spinoff until such guarantee obligation is substituted for guarantees issued by Lamb Weston. Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, dated as of November 8, 2016 (the \"Separation Agreement\"), between us and Lamb Weston, this guarantee arrangement is deemed a liability of Lamb Weston that was transferred to Lamb Weston as part of the Spinoff. Accordingly, in the event that we are required to make any payments as a result of this guarantee arrangement, Lamb Weston is obligated to indemnify us for any such liability, reduced by any insurance proceeds received by us, in accordance with the terms of the indemnification provisions under the Separation Agreement.\n\nLamb Weston is a party to an agricultural sublease agreement with a third party for certain farmland through 2020 (subject, at Lamb Weston's option, to extension for two additional five-year periods). Under the terms of the sublease agreement, Lamb\n\n38"

            "137 Vodafone Group Plc\n\nAnnual Report 2019\n\n6. Taxation\n\nThis note explains how our Group tax charge arises. The deferred tax section of the note also provides information on our expected future tax charges and sets out the tax assets held across the Group together with our view on whether or not we expect to be able to make use of these in the future.\n\nAccounting policies Income tax expense represents the sum of the current and deferred taxes.\n\nCurrent tax payable or recoverable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because some items of income or expense are taxable or deductible in different years or may never be taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.\n\nThe Group recognises provisions for uncertain tax positions when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and management judge that it is probable that there will be a future outflow of economic benefits from the Group to settle the obligation. Uncertain tax positions are assessed and measured on an issue by issue basis within the jurisdictions that we operate using management’s estimate of the most likely outcome. The Group recognises interest on late paid taxes as part of financing costs, and any penalties, if applicable, as part of the income tax expense.\n\nDeferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in the future arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. It is accounted for using the statement of financial position liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that temporary differences or taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.\n\nSuch assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised to the extent they arise from the initial recognition of non-tax deductible goodwill.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint arrangements, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting period date and adjusted to reflect changes in the Group’s assessment that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.\n\nTax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they either relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities which intend to settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\n\nTax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the tax is recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity.\n\nIncome tax expense\n\n2019 €m\n\n2018 €m\n\nUnited Kingdom corporation tax expense/(credit):\n\nCurrent year1 Adjustments in respect of prior years\n\n21 (9) 12\n\n70 (5) 65\n\nOverseas current tax expense/(credit):\n\nCurrent year Adjustments in respect of prior years\n\nTotal current tax expense\n\n1,098 (48) 1,050 1,062\n\n1,055 (102) 953 1,018\n\nDeferred tax on origination and reversal of temporary differences:\n\nUnited Kingdom deferred tax Overseas deferred tax\n\nTotal deferred tax expense/(credit) Total income tax expense/(credit)\n\n(232) 666 434 1,496\n\n39 (1,936) (1,897) (879)\n\nNote: 1 The income statement tax charge includes tax relief on capitalised interest.\n\nUK operating profits are more than offset by statutory allowances for capital investment in the UK network and systems plus ongoing interest costs including those arising from the €10.3 billion of spectrum payments to the UK government in 2000 and 2013.\n\n2017 €m\n\n27 (3) 24\n\n961 (35) 926 950\n\n",

Volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was flat in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior-year period. This result reflected merchandising changes and price elasticity-related declines in certain brands, as well as isolated production challenges, partially offset by the continued benefit from momentum and innovation successes in the snacks businesses. Price/ mix was flat compared to the prior year as unfavorable mix, coupled with increases in brand building investments with retailers were offset by the impact of higher pricing. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC, which was completed in October 2017, contributed $41.3 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 results included $115.9 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $156.4 million of net sales related to this divested business.\n\nRefrigerated & Frozen net sales for fiscal 2019 were $2.80 billion, an increase of $51.0 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 1% increase in volume compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales volumes was a result of innovation across multiple brands, which was partially offset by the effects of reduced merchandising spend and the impact of a recall during the fourth quarter. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2018, as continued delivery of top-line accretive innovation in several brands was partially offset by brand building investments with retailers. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business, which was completed in February 2018, contributed $25.7 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition.\n\nInternational net sales for fiscal 2019 were $793.4 million, a decrease of $50.1 million, or 6%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 2% increase in volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, a 4% decrease due to foreign exchange rates, and a 2% increase in price/mix, in each case compared to fiscal 2018. The volume and price/ mix increases for fiscal 2019 were driven by growth in the Canadian snacks and frozen businesses. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $3.7 million to International net sales for fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 included $4.1 million of net sales related to our Del Monte® processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada, which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $48.9 million of net sales related to this divested business. In addition, fiscal 2019 and 2018 results included $17.1 million and $24.5 million, respectively, related to our divested Wesson® oil business.\n\nFoodservice net sales for fiscal 2019 were $934.2 million, a decrease of $120.6 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 14% decrease in volume, excluding divestitures. The decline in volume reflected the continued execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy and the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Price/mix increased 5% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in price/mix for fiscal 2019 reflected favorable product and customer mix, the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing, and the execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy. Fiscal 2019 included $34.2 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $53.4 million of net sales related to this divested business. Net sales declined by approximately 7% in fiscal 2019 due to the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility.\n\nPinnacle Foods net sales for fiscal 2019 (reflecting 213 days of Conagra Brands ownership) were $1.73 billion.

During 2019, we also sold the first 12 teams for the Call of Duty League, which began its first season in January 2020.\n\nInternational Sales\n\nInternational sales are a fundamental part of our business. An important element of our international strategy is to develop\n\ncontent that is specifically directed toward local cultures and customs. Net revenues from international sales accounted for approximately 54%, 54%, and 55% of our total consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The majority of our net revenues from foreign countries are generated by consumers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business, including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changes in local economies. Accordingly, our future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in local economies.\n\nOperating Metrics\n\nThe following operating metrics are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business. The key drivers of\n\nchanges in our operating metrics are presented in the order of significance.\n\nNet bookings and In-game net bookings\n\nWe monitor net bookings as a key operating metric in evaluating the performance of our business because it enables an analysis of performance based on the timing of actual transactions with our customers and provides more timely indication of trends in our operating results. Net bookings is the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period, and includes license fees, merchandise, and publisher incentives, among others. Net bookings is equal to net revenues excluding the impact from deferrals. In-game net bookings primarily includes the net amount of downloadable content and microtransactions sold during the period, and is equal to in-game net revenues excluding the impact from deferrals.\n\nNet bookings and in-game net bookings were as follows (amounts in millions):\n\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nIncrease (Decrease)\n\nNet bookings\n\n$\n\n6,388\n\n$\n\n7,262\n\n$\n\nIn-game net bookings\n\n$\n\n3,366\n\n$\n\n4,203\n\n$\n\nNet bookings\n\nThe decrease in net bookings for 2019, as compared to 2018, was primarily due to:\n\n\n\na $572 million decrease in Blizzard net bookings primarily driven by (1) lower net bookings from Hearthstone and (2) overall lower net bookings from World of Warcraft expansion and in-game content sales, primarily due to World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth, which was released in August 2018, with no comparable release in 2019 (although net bookings from subscriptions increased due to the release of World of Warcraft Classic in August 2019);\n\n\n\na $239 million decrease in Activision net bookings primarily driven by (1) lower net bookings from the Destiny franchise (reflecting our sale of the publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie in December 2018) and (2) lower net bookings from Call of Duty franchise catalog titles, partially offset by net bookings from Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled, and Call of Duty: Mobile, which were new releases in March 2019, June 2019, and October 2019, respectively; and\n\n33\n\n33\n\n",

In local currency, adjusted EBITDA amounted to US$351.3 million compared to US$288.4 million for fiscal 2018. The increase was mainly due to the impact of the MetroCast and FiberLight acquisitions combined with strong organic growth.\n\nExcluding the MetroCast and FiberLight acquisitions and the prior year's non-recurring costs of $3.1 million ($US2.5 million) related to hurricane Irma, adjusted EBITDA in constant currency increased by 5.7% for fiscal 2019.\n\nCAPITAL INTENSITY AND ACQUISITIONS OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\n\nFiscal 2019 acquisitions of property, plant and equipment decreased by 9.4% (12.4% in constant currency) mainly due to:\n\n\n\nthe acquisition of several dark fibres throughout south Florida from FiberLight, LLC for a consideration of $21.2 million (US$16.8 million) during the second quarter of fiscal 2018; partly offset by\n\n\n\nadditional capital expenditures related to the impact of the MetroCast acquisition; and\n\n\n\nadditional capital expenditures related to the expansion in Florida.\n\nFiscal 2019 capital intensity reached 18.6% compared to 25.1% for fiscal 2018 mainly as a result of lower capital expenditures combined with revenue growth.\n\nCUSTOMER STATISTICS\n\nCustomer counts at August 31, 2019\n\nCustomer counts at August 31, 2018\n\nInternet 446,137 49.5%\n\nInternet 424,948 48.0%\n\nVideo 312,555 34.7%\n\nTelephony 142,754 15.8%\n\nVideo 317,252 35.9%\n\nTelephony 142,265 16.1%\n\nNet additions (losses)\n\n% of penetration(2)(3)\n\nYears ended\n\nAugust 31, 2019\n\nAugust 31, 2019\n\nAugust 31,\n\n2018 (1)\n\nAugust 31, 2019\n\nAugust 31,\n\n2018 (3)\n\nPrimary service units\n\n901,446\n\n16,981\n\n20,251\n\nInternet service customers\n\n446,137\n\n21,189\n\n21,417\n\n50.8\n\n49.7\n\nVideo service customers\n\n312,555\n\n(4,697)\n\n(6,760)\n\n35.6\n\n37.1\n\nTelephony service customers\n\n142,754\n\n489\n\n5,594\n\n16.2\n\n16.6\n\n(1) Excludes 251,379 primary services units (130,404 Internet services, 87,873 video services and 33,102 telephony services) from the MetroCast acquisition\n\ncompleted in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\n\n(2) As a percentage of homes passed.\n\n(3) In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the number of homes passed in the American broadband services segment have been adjusted upwards in order to reflect the number of non-served multi-dwelling unit passings within the footprint and consequently, the penetration as a percentage of homes passed for fiscal 2018 have also been adjusted.\n\n34 COGECO COMMUNICATIONS INC. 2019 ANNUAL REPORT MD&A\n\nINTERNET\n\nFiscal 2019 Internet service customers net additions stood at 21,189 compared to 21,417 for the prior year as a result of:\n\n\n\nadditional connects related to the Florida expansion initiatives and in the MetroCast footprint;\n\n\n\nour customers' ongoing interest in high speed offerings; and\n\n\n\ngrowth in both the residential and business sectors.\n\nVIDEO\n\nFiscal 2019 video service customers net losses stood at 4,697 compared to 6,760 for the prior year mainly from:\n\n\n\ncompetitive offers in the industry; and\n\n\n\na changing video consumption environment; partly offset by\n\n\n\nour customers' ongoing interest in TiVo's digital advanced video services; and\n\n\n\nthe activation of bulk properties in Florida during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.\n\nTELEPHONY\n\nFiscal 2019 telephony service customers net additions stood at 489 compared to 5,594 for the prior year mainly as a result of the growth in the business sector, partly offset by a decline in the residential sector.\n\nDISTRIBUTION OF CUSTOMERS\n\nAt August 31, 2019, 52% of the American broadband services segment's customers enjoyed \"double play\" or \"triple play\" bundled services.\n\nCOGECO COMMUNICATIONS INC.",

The year-over-year increase reflected both higher service and product revenues of 0.9% and 5.7%, respectively.\n\nBCE net earnings increased by 12.6% in Q4 2019, compared to Q4 2018, mainly due to higher adjusted EBITDA, lower other expense and lower severance, acquisition and other costs. This was partly offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense and finance costs. The adoption of IFRS 16 did not have a significant impact on net earnings.\n\nBCE adjusted EBITDA increased by 4.8% in Q4 2019, compared to Q4 2018, driven by growth across all three of our segments. This resulted in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 39.7% in the quarter, up 1.2 pts over Q4 2018, primarily due to the favourable impact from the adoption of IFRS 16 in 2019.\n\nBell Wireless operating revenues increased by 3.6% in Q4 2019, compared to Q4 2018, driven by higher service and product revenues. Service revenues grew by 1.6% year over year due to continued growth in both our postpaid and prepaid subscriber base along with rate increases and a greater mix of customers subscribing to higher-value monthly plans including unlimited data plans. This was moderated by greater sales of premium handsets along with the impact of higher- value monthly plans, and lower data overage driven by increased customer adoption of unlimited data plans. Product revenues grew by 7.4% year over year, driven by increased sales of premium handsets and the impact of higher-value monthly plans in our sales mix.\n\nBell Wireless adjusted EBITDA increased by 7.4% in Q4 2019, compared to the same period last year, mainly driven by the flow-through of higher revenues, partially offset by higher operating expenses of 1.4% year over year. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher product cost of goods sold from greater mix of premium handsets and increased handset costs, higher network operating costs to support the growth in our subscriber base and data consumption and higher bad debt expense driven by the growth in revenues. This was offset in part by the favourable impact from the adoption of IFRS 16 in 2019. Adjusted EBITDA margin, based on wireless operating revenues, of 37.9% increased by 1.4 pts over Q4 2018, mainly due to the impact from the adoption of IFRS 16, greater service revenue flow-through and promotional spending discipline during the holiday season, moderated by higher low-margin product sales in our total revenue base.\n\nBCE Inc. 2019 Annual Report\n\nQ4 2019\n\nQ4 2018\n\n$ CHANGE\n\n% CHANGE\n\n2,493\n\n2,407\n\n86\n\n3.6%\n\n3,138\n\n3,137\n\n1\n\n–\n\n879\n\n850\n\n29\n\n3.4%\n\n(194)\n\n(179)\n\n(15)\n\n(8.4%)\n\n6,316\n\n6,215\n\n101\n\n1.6%\n\nQ4 2019\n\nQ4 2018\n\n$ CHANGE\n\n% CHANGE\n\n944\n\n879\n\n65\n\n7.4%\n\n1,359\n\n1,339\n\n20\n\n1.5%\n\n205\n\n176\n\n29\n\n16.5%\n\n2,508\n\n2,394\n\n114\n\n4.8%\n\nBell Wireline operating revenues remained unchanged in Q4 2019, compared to Q4 2018, resulting from stable year-over-year service revenue which increased 0.1%, as the continued expansion of our retail Internet and IPTV subscriber bases, residential rate increases, contribution from the federal election and higher business solution services revenue were offset by ongoing subscriber erosion in voice and satellite TV, greater acquisition, retention and bundle discounts on residential services to match competitor promotions, lower TV pay-per-view revenues and a decline in IP connectivity revenues due in part to migration to Internet based services. Product revenues were relatively stable year over year, declining 0.6% or $1 million.\n\nBell Wireline adjusted EBITDA grew by 1.5% in Q4 2019, compared to Q4 2018, mainly due to lower operating costs of 1.1%, driven by the favourable impact from the adoption of IFRS 16 in 2019 and continued effective cost containment. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 0.6 pts to 43.3% in Q4 2019, compared to Q4 2018, mainly due to the favourable impact from the adoption of IFRS 16 in 2019.\n\nBell Media operating revenues increased by 3.4% in Q4 2019, compared to the same period last year, driven by increased subscriber revenues from the continued growth in Crave due to higher subscribers along with rate increases following the launch of our enhanced Crave service in November 2018 and also reflected the favourability from BDU contract renewals. Advertising revenues declined modestly in Q4 2019, compared to Q4 2018, from lower conventional TV advertising revenues and ongoing market softness in radio, partially offset by continued growth in specialty TV and OOH advertising revenues.\n\nBell Media adjusted EBITDA increased by 16.5% in Q4 2019, compared to the same period last year, driven by higher operating revenues coupled with stable operating expenses as the favourable impact from the adoption of IFRS 16 in 2019 was offset by the growth in programming and content costs related to higher sports broadcast rights costs and ongoing Crave content expansion.\n\nBCE capital expenditures of $1,153 million in Q4 2019 increased by $179 million over Q4 2018 and corresponded to a capital intensity ratio of 18.3% compared to 15.7% last year. The growth in capital investments was driven by increases across all three of our segments. Wireline capital spending was $96 million higher year over year, mainly due to the timing of our spending, driven by the roll-out of fixed WTTP to rural locations in Ontario and Québec."

The results of our acquired companies have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition and have contributed to our revenues, income, earnings per share and total assets.\n\nAs of and for the Year Ended May 31,\n\n(in millions, except per share amounts) Consolidated Statements of Operations Data: Total revenues Operating income Net income (1) Earnings per share—diluted (1) Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding Cash dividends declared per common share Consolidated Balance Sheets Data: Working capital (2) Total assets (2) Notes payable and other borrowings (3)\n\n$ $ $ $\n\n$\n\n$ $ $\n\n2019\n\n39,506 $ 13,535 $ 11,083 $ 2.97 $\n\n3,732\n\n0.81 $\n\n27,756 $ 108,709 $ 56,167 $\n\n2018 (4)\n\n39,383 $ 13,264 $ 3,587 $ 0.85 $\n\n4,238\n\n0.76 $\n\n57,035 $ 137,851 $ 60,619 $\n\n2017 (4)\n\n37,792 $ 12,913 $ 9,452 $ 2.24 $\n\n4,217\n\n0.64 $\n\n50,995 $ 136,003 $ 57,909 $\n\n2016 (4)\n\n37,047 $ 12,604 $ 8,901 $ 2.07 $\n\n4,305\n\n0.60 $\n\n47,105 $ 112,180 $ 43,855 $\n\n(1)\n\nOur net income and diluted earnings per share were impacted in fiscal 2019 and 2018 by the effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act). The more significant provisions of the Tax Act as applicable to us are described below under “Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017”.\n\n(2)\n\nWorking capital and total assets decreased in fiscal 2019 primarily due to $36.1 billion of cash used for repurchases of our common stock during fiscal 2019 and also due to dividend payments, partially offset by the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our fiscal 2019 net income. Working capital and total assets sequentially increased in nearly all of the fiscal 2015 to 2018 periods presented primarily due to the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income generated during the periods presented and the issuances of long-term senior notes of $10.0 billion in fiscal 2018, and $14.0 billion in fiscal 2017. These working capital and total assets increases were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments in the fiscal 2015 to 2018 periods presented. In addition, our total assets were also affected in all periods presented by the repayments of notes payable and other borrowings as discussed further below.\n\n(3)\n\nOur notes payable and other borrowings, which represented the summation of our notes payable and other borrowings, current, and notes payable and other borrowings, non-current, as reported per our consolidated balance sheets as of the dates listed in the table above, decreased during fiscal 2019 primarily due to repayments of certain short-term borrowings and senior notes. Notes payable and other borrowings increased between fiscal 2015 and 2018 primarily due to the fiscal 2018 issuance of long-term senior notes of $10.0 billion and short-term borrowings of $2.5 billion, the fiscal 2017 issuance of long-term senior notes of $14.0 billion and short-term borrowings of $3.8 billion, and the fiscal 2016 short-term borrowings of $3.8 billion. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report for additional information regarding our notes payable and other borrowings.\n\n(4)\n\nThe summary consolidated financial data for the fiscal years ended and as of May 31, 2018 and 2017 have been retrospectively restated to reflect the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606 and subsequent amendments to the initial guidance: ASU 2015-14, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-12, ASU 2016-20, ASU 2017-10, ASU 2017-13 and ASU 2017-14 (collectively, Topic 606), and ASU 2017-07, Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the presentation of Net Periodic Pension Costs and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Costs (ASU 2017-07).

            "172 Vodafone Group Plc\n\nAnnual Report 2019\n\n24. Post employment benefits\n\nThe Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans for our employees. The Group’s largest defined benefit scheme is in the UK. For further details see “Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty” in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAccounting policies For defined benefit retirement plans, the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the plan liabilities is recognised as an asset or liability on the statement of financial position. Scheme liabilities are assessed using the projected unit funding method and applying the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting period date. Assets are valued at market value.\n\nActuarial gains and losses are taken to the statement of comprehensive income as incurred. For this purpose, actuarial gains and losses comprise both the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising from differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred. The return on plan assets, in excess of interest income, and costs incurred for the management of plan assets are also taken to other comprehensive income.\n\nOther movements in the net surplus or deficit are recognised in the income statement, including the current service cost, any past service cost and the effect of any settlements. The interest cost less the expected interest income on assets is also charged to the income statement. The amount charged to the income statement in respect of these plans is included within operating costs or in the Group’s share of the results of equity accounted operations, as appropriate.\n\nThe Group’s contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the income statement as they fall due.\n\nBackground At 31 March 2019 the Group operated a number of pension plans for the benefit of its employees throughout the world, with varying rights and obligations depending on the conditions and practices in the countries concerned. The Group’s pension plans are provided through both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements. Defined benefit schemes provide benefits based on the employees’ length of pensionable service and their final pensionable salary or other criteria. Defined contribution schemes offer employees individual funds that are converted into benefits at the time of retirement.\n\nThe Group operates defined benefit schemes in Germany, Ghana, India, Ireland, Italy, the UK, the United States and the Group operates defined benefit indemnity plans in Greece and Turkey. Defined contribution pension schemes are currently provided in Egypt, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Portugal, South Africa, Spain and the UK.\n\nIncome statement expense\n\nDefined contribution schemes Defined benefit schemes Total amount charged to income statement (note 23)\n\n2019 €m 166 57 223\n\n2018 €m 178 44 222\n\n2017 €m 192 20 212\n\nDefined benefit schemes The Group’s retirement policy is to provide competitive pension provision, in each operating country, in line with the market median for that location. The Group’s preferred retirement provision is focused on Defined Contribution (‘DC’) arrangements and/or State provision for future service.\n\nThe Group’s main defined benefit funding liability is the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme (‘Vodafone UK plan’). Since June 2014 the plan has consisted of two segregated sections: the Vodafone Section and the Cable & Wireless Section (‘CWW Section’). Both sections are closed to new entrants and to future accrual. The Group also operates smaller funded and unfunded plans in the UK, funded and unfunded plans in Germany and funded plans in Ireland. Defined benefit pension provision exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as longer than expected longevity of participants, lower than expected return on investments and higher than expected inflation, which may increase the liabilities or reduce the value of assets of the schemes.\n\nThe main defined benefit schemes are administered by trustee boards which are legally separate from the Group and consist of representatives who are employees, former employees or are independent from the Company. The boards of the pension schemes are required by legislation to act in the best interest of the participants, set the investment strategy and contribution rates and are subject to statutory funding objectives.\n\nThe Vodafone UK plan is registered as an occupational pension plan with HM Revenue and Customs (‘HMRC’) and is subject to UK legislation and operates within the framework outlined by the Pensions Regulator. UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently and that valuations are undertaken at least every three years. Separate valuations are required for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section.\n\nThe trustees obtain regular actuarial valuations to check whether the statutory funding objective is met and whether a recovery plan is required to restore funding to the level of the agreed technical provisions. On 19 October 2017, the 31 March 2016 triennial actuarial valuation for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section of the Vodafone UK plan, which is used to judge the funding the Group needs to put into the scheme, was concluded.",

As a hedging arrangement of the pension plan, the transaction requires no cash contributions from BCE.\n\nDebt securities included approximately $53 million of Bell Canada debentures, or 0.21% of total plan assets, at December 31, 2019 and approximately $68 million of Bell Canada debentures, or 0.30% of total plan assets, at December 31, 2018.\n\nAlternative investments included an investment in MLSE of $135 million, or 0.53% of total plan assets, at December 31, 2019 and $135 million, or 0.59% of total plan assets, at December 31, 2018.\n\nThe Bell Canada pension plan has an investment arrangement which hedges part of its exposure to potential increases in longevity, which covers approximately $4 billion of post-employment benefit obligations.\n\nCASH FLOWS\n\nWe are responsible for adequately funding our DB pension plans. We make contributions to them based on various actuarial cost methods that are permitted by pension regulatory authorities. Contributions reflect actuarial assumptions about future investment returns, salary projections and future service benefits. Changes in these factors could cause actual future contributions to differ from our current estimates and could require us to increase contributions to our post-employment benefit plans in the future, which could have a negative effect on our liquidity and financial performance.\n\nWe contribute to the DC pension plans as employees provide service.\n\nThe following table shows the amounts we contributed to the DB and DC pension plans and the payments made to beneficiaries under OPEB plans.\n\nDB PLANS (1)\n\nDC PLANS\n\nOPEB PLANS\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nContributions/payments\n\n(180)\n\n(433)\n\n(110)\n\n(106)\n\n(72)\n\n(75)\n\n(1) Includes voluntary contributions of nil in 2019 and $240 million in 2018.\n\nWe expect to contribute approximately $170 million to our DB pension plans in 2020, subject to actuarial valuations being completed.

Recipients may earn between 0% and 150% of the target number of shares based on the Company's achievement of total shareholder return in comparisonto a peer group of companies in the Nasdaq composite index over a period of approximately three years. The fair value of the awards was estimated using a MonteCarlo simulation and compensation expense is recognized ratably over the service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards of $3.5 million subject tothe market condition. The expected volatility of the Company's common stock was estimated based on the historical average volatility rate over the three-yearperiod.

The weighted-average exercise price of these awards was $43 per share.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, there was $1.1 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs, which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining weighted- average contractual term of approximately 2.5 years.\n\nIn connection with vesting and release of RSUs and PSUs, the tax benefits realized by the company for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $131 million, $117 million and $180 million, respectively.\n\nStock Options In 2016, the company made one grant of 1.5 million premium- priced stock options. The option award was granted with a three-year cliff vesting period and a 10-year contractual term. The award’s cost of $12 million was recognized ratably over the three-year vesting period. As of December 31, 2019, these options were vested with a weighted-average exercise price of $140 per share and had a remaining weighted-average contractual life of approximately 6.1 years. The options were exercisable within a range of $129 to $154. The total intrinsic value of these vested options as of December 31, 2019 was $1.9 million.\n\nThe company has not granted options since 2016. No stock options were exercised, forfeited or canceled during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $7 million. In connection with this exercise, $11 million in cash was received from employees and the company realized a tax benefit of $2 million.\n\nIBM Employees Stock Purchase Plan The company maintains a non-compensatory Employees Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP enables eligible participants to purchase shares of IBM common stock at a 5 percent discount off the average market price on the day of purchase through payroll deductions of up to 10 percent of eligible compensation. Eligible compensation includes any compensation received by the employee during the year. The ESPP provides for semi-annual offering periods during which shares may be purchased and continues as long as shares remain available under the ESPP, unless terminated earlier at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Individual ESPP participants are restricted from purchasing more than $25,000 of common stock in one calendar year or 1,000 shares in an offering period.\n\nEmployees purchased approximately 1.0 million shares under the ESPP during each year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Cash dividends declared and paid by the company on its common stock also include cash dividends on the company stock purchased through the ESPP. Dividends are paid on full and fractional shares and can be reinvested. The company stock purchased through the ESPP is considered outstanding and is included in the weighted-average outstanding shares for purposes of computing basic and diluted earnings per share.\n\nApproximately 18.8 million shares were available for purchase under the ESPP at December 31, 2019.\n\nThe company settles employee stock option exercises primarily with newly issued common shares and, occasionally, with treasury shares. Total treasury shares held at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were approximately 1,351 million and 1,341 million shares, respectively.",

If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\nGoodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the cash-generating unit to which it relates is greater than the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use.\n\nFor the year-ended 31 March 2019, the Directors have reviewed the value of goodwill based on internal value in use calculations. The key assumptions for these calculations are discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to billings and direct costs during the period.\n\nThe Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the Directors’ most recent financial forecasts for the following five years. The growth rates for the five-year period are based on Directors’ expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the cash-generating unit, planned growth in market share, industry forecasts, growth in the market and specific regional considerations and are in line with past experience. Discount rates have been estimated based on rates that reflect current market assessments of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital.\n\nThe key assumptions used in the assessments in the year-ended 31 March 2019 are as follows:\n\nAmericas\n\nEMEA\n\nAPJ\n\nLong-term regional growth rate beyond five years\n\n2.5%\n\n1.5%\n\n2.0%\n\nDiscount rate\n\n9.0%\n\n9.0%\n\n10.0%\n\nThe key assumptions used in the assessments in the year-ended 31 March 2018 were as follows:\n\nAmericas\n\nEMEA\n\nAPJ\n\nLong-term regional growth rate beyond five years\n\n2.5%\n\n1.5%\n\n2.0%\n\nDiscount rate\n\n9.5%\n\n9.5%\n\n10.5%\n\nAs at 31 March 2019, there were no indicators of impairment that suggested the carrying amounts of the Group’s long-lived assets are not recoverable. In order to assess the sensitivity in the assumptions made, the Directors have flexed the discount rate upward by thirty per cent of the above rates, and noted that this still did not give any indication of impairment.\n\n153",

In conjunction with the changes to reporting units, we reassigned goodwill between CGD and CMS based on their relative fair values on October 1, 2017.\n\nIn July 2017, we acquired Deltenna, a wireless infrastructure company specializing in the design and delivery of radio and antenna communication solutions. Deltenna’s operations were included in our CGD reporting unit upon its acquisition. On April 1, 2019, we reorganized our reporting structure to include Deltenna in our CMS reporting unit and reassigned $3.4 million of goodwill from CGD to CMS based upon its relative fair value. Since its acquisition, Deltenna’s sales, operating results, and cash flows have not been significant to our consolidated results. As such, reportable segment information has not been restated for this change in the composition of our reportable segments.\n\nWe complete our annual goodwill impairment test each year as of July 1 separately for our CTS, CGD and CMS reporting units.\n\nThe test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process. The first step of the test is performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including recorded goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment, if any, by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount. Any resulting impairment determined would be recorded in the current period.\n\nFor our 2019 impairment test, the estimated fair value of all three of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts. As such, there was no impairment of goodwill in 2019.\n\nSignificant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that are used in our impairment analysis. The estimates we used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business. Although we believe our underlying assumptions supporting these assessments are reasonable, if our forecasted sales and margin growth rates, timing of growth, or the discount rate vary from our forecasts, we may be required to perform interim analyses in fiscal 2020 that could expose us to material impairment charges in the future.\n\n107\n\nTotal\n\n",

Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill\n\nThe Company evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the beginning of the fourth quarter each year and at an interim date, if indicators of potential impairment exist. Goodwill impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (also known as a component), for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit.\n\nAt the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test on its reporting units. The Company utilizes a combination of an income and market value approach to estimate the fair value of each of its reporting units. Cash flow projections are based on management’s estimates of revenue growth rates and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") margins, taking into consideration business and market conditions for the countries and markets in which the reporting unit operates. The Company calculates the discount rate based on a market-participant, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, which considers industry specific rates of return on debt and equity capital for a target industry capital structure, adjusted for risks associated with business size, geography and other factors specific to the reporting unit. The market value approach is based on appropriate valuation multiples observed for the reporting unit’s guideline public companies.\n\nThe goodwill impairment assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the\n\nreporting units exceeded its respective carrying value. The Company does not believe that any of its reporting units are at risk for impairment.\n\nA summary of the changes in goodwill by reportable segment is as follows:\n\n(Dollars in Millions)\n\nAutomotive\n\nIndustrial\n\nTotal\n\nBalance as of April 30, 2016\n\nForeign Currency Translation\n\nBalance as of April 29, 2017\n\n$\n\n— $\n\n—\n\n—\n\n1.7 (0.1) 1.6\n\n$\n\n1.7 (0.1) 1.6\n\nAcquisitions\n\n57.2\n\n—\n\n57.2\n\nForeign Currency Translation\n\n0.3\n\n0.1\n\n0.4\n\nBalance as of April 28, 2018\n\n57.5\n\n1.7\n\n59.2\n\nAcquisitions\n\nForeign Currency Translation\n\nBalance as of April 27, 2019\n\n$\n\n49.4 (0.6) 106.3\n\n$\n\n125.9 (0.6) 127.0\n\n$\n\n175.3 (1.2) 233.3\n\n"

            "Table of Contents\n\nThe $16.9 million increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to a $15.5 million increase in personnel costs associated with higheraverage headcount in fiscal year 2019 driven by the Cyence acquisition, as well as a $2.6 million increase in web hosting costs incurred in order to support thedevelopment of our new products including our subscription offerings, to enhance our existing products, and to migrate our products to the cloud, partially offsetby a decrease of $1.2 million in professional services costs.Our research and development headcount was 724 as of July 31, 2019 compared with 749 as of July 31, 2018. Average headcount during fiscal year 2019,however, increased by 54 as compared to average headcount during fiscal year 2018, primarily due to the Cyence acquisition that closed on November 1, 2017,which resulted in increased personnel costs, despite the decrease in headcount as of the end of fiscal year 2019 versus the end of fiscal year 2018.We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to hire and dedicate internal resources to developing,improving, and expanding the functionality of our solutions and migrating our solutions to the cloud. Research and development expenses may also increase if wepursue additional acquisitions.Sales and MarketingOur sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for our sales and marketing employees. It also includes travel expenses, professionalservices for marketing activities, and amortization of certain acquired intangibles.The $6.6 million increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to increases of $14.2 million in personnel expenses due to higher headcount tosell our products and $1.4 million due to the amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease of $9.4 million due to the change in accounting forcommission costs under ASC 606. Under ASC 606, certain commissions are capitalized when earned and expensed over the anticipated period of time that goodsand services are expected to be provided to a customer, which we estimate to be approximately five years.Our sales and marketing headcount was 354 as of July 31, 2019 compared with 329 as of July 31, 2018.We expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in sales and marketing activities to supportour business growth and objectives.General and AdministrativeOur general and administrative expenses include executive, finance, human resources, legal, and corporate development and strategy functions, andprimarily consist of personnel costs, as well as professional services.The $1.5 million decrease in our general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease in professional services of $10.2 million,partially offset by increases of $6.1 million in personnel expenses due to higher headcount and $2.5 million in software and cloud infrastructure costs to supportour growth. Professional services were higher in the prior year period as a result of professional services incurred in connection with our acquisition of Cyence andimplementation costs of a new enterprise resource planning platform and a new product configuration and quoting system.Our general and administrative headcount was 298 as of July 31, 2019 compared with 255 as of July 31, 2018. General and administrative headcountincludes personnel in information technology support, information security, and facilities, which are allocated across all functional departments.We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in personnel, corporate infrastructure, andsystems required to support our strategic initiatives, the growth of our business, and our compliance and reporting obligations.Other Income (Expense) Fiscal years ended July 31, 20192018 Change Amount Amount ($) (%) (In thousands, except percentages)Interest income$30,182 $13,281 16,901 127Interest expense$(17,334) $(6,442) (10,892) 169Other income (expense), net$(1,867) $509 (2,376) (467)Interest IncomeInterest income represents interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and investments."

During fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements primarily impacting the Industrial Solutions and Transportation Solutions segments. In connection with these initiatives, we incurred net restructuring charges of $255 million and $140 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. Annualized cost savings related to actions initiated in fiscal 2019 are expected to be approximately $220 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2021. Cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses.\n\nIn response to market weakness in fiscal 2019, we initiated incremental restructuring actions, primarily consisting of employee severance, to broaden the scope of our cost reduction initiatives and accelerate cost reduction and factory footprint consolidation activities. We previously disclosed that we expected total restructuring charges to be approximately $375 million in fiscal 2019. We now expect certain of these actions to occur in fiscal 2020 or 2021.

This decrease was due to a $5.2 million decrease in products revenue, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in services revenue. The decrease in products revenue was primarily driven by lower demand from our service provider customers in the Americas. Revenues from service provider customers decreased 10% in 2018 compared to 2017. Revenue from enterprise customers remained relatively constant in 2018 compared to 2017.\n\nProducts revenue decreased $5.2 million, or 3%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by lower demand from our service provider customers in the Americas, as well as decreases from EMEA, offset in part by a $2.6 million increase from the adoption of ASC 606 in 2018 and by the increase in products revenue primarily from Japan and Asia Pacific.

The increase was mainly due to higher product revenues driven by higher demand from our service providers in Japan.\n\nDuring 2018, $36.9 million, or 16%, of total revenue was generated from the Asia Pacific regions excluding Japan, which represents a 11% increase compared to 2017.

The net increase in the total valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 is primarily related to the increase of a net operating loss carry forward due to a release of a non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefit and the increase of deferred tax assets in sites with existing valuation allowances.

            "At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our restricted investments consisted of long-term marketable securities that were also held in custodial accounts to fund the estimated future costs of collecting and recycling modules covered under our solar module collection and recycling program. As necessary, we fund any incremental amounts for our estimated collection and recycling obligations on an annual basis based on the estimated costs of collecting and recycling covered modules, estimated rates of return on our restricted investments, and an estimated solar module life of 25 years less amounts already funded in prior years. To ensure that amounts previously funded will be available in the future regardless of potential adverse changes in our financial condition (even in the case of our own insolvency), we have established a trust under which estimated funds are put into custodial accounts with an established and reputable bank, for which First Solar, Inc.; First Solar Malaysia Sdn. Bhd.; and First Solar Manufacturing GmbH are grantors. Trust funds may be disbursed for qualified module collection and recycling costs (including capital and facility related recycling costs), payments to customers for assuming collection and recycling obligations, and reimbursements of any overfunded amounts. Investments in the trust must meet certain investment quality criteria comparable to highly rated government or agency bonds.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold certain restricted investments for proceeds of $281.6 million and realized gains of $40.6 million on such sales as part of efforts to align the currencies of the investments with those of the corresponding collection and recycling liabilities and disburse $22.2 million of overfunded amounts. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold certain restricted investments for proceeds of $231.1 million and realized gains of $55.4 million on such sales as part of an effort to align the currencies of the investments with those corresponding collection and recycling liabilities and disburse $143.1 million of overfunded amounts.

Respectively, in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, the $0.8 million, $1.3 million, and $0.8 million cash flows used in financing activities were primarily comprised of the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding and to cover the exercise price of the options, and payments on capital lease obligations.\n\nInvestments\n\nInvestments in Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies\n\nAgilysys invests in corporate-owned life insurance policies for certain former executives, for which some are endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements. We entered into non-cancelable agreements with each of the former executives, whereby we must maintain the life insurance policy for a specified amount and split a portion of the policy benefits with their designated beneficiary. Our investment in these corporate-owned life insurance policies were recorded at their cash surrender value, which approximates fair value at the balance sheet date. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the balance sheet date, the cash surrender value of $0.9 million for the remaining policies were held in “Other non-current assets,” and the present value of future proceeds owed to those executives' designated beneficiary of $0.1 million, which approximates fair value, were recorded within \"Other non-current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the balance sheet date.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\n\nContractual Obligations\n\nThe following table provides aggregate information regarding our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2019.\n\n(In thousands) Operating leases (1) Capital leases Asset retirement obligation Total contractual obligations (2)\n\n$\n\n$\n\nTotal 19,437 $ 65 400 19,902 $\n\n2020\n\n4,143 $ 27 — 4,170 $\n\n2021-2022\n\n7,111 $ 38 150 7,299 $\n\n2023-2024\n\n3,686 $ — 250 3,936 $\n\n(1) Operating lease obligations are presented net of contractually binding sub-lease arrangements.

The Scheme holds a significant proportion of growth assets (equities, diversified growth fund and global absolute return fund) which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term. The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Scheme’s long-term objectives.\n\nInflation risk\n\nA proportion of the Scheme’s benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation leads to higher liabilities (although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation). The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.\n\nChange in bond yields\n\nA decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the Scheme’s liabilities for accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Scheme’s bond holdings.\n\nLife expectancy\n\nThe majority of the Scheme’s obligations are to provide benefits for the lifetime of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.\n\nFunding requirements UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently. The ongoing funding valuation of the Scheme was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 30 April 2018 and showed a deficit of £0.2m. The Company paid deficit contributions of £70,000 for the year ending 31 March 2019 (2018: £70,000), and has committed to contribute £140,000 per annum from 1 April 2019, which is expected to make good this shortfall by 31 March 2020. The next funding valuation is due no later than 30 April 2021, at which progress towards full-funding will be reviewed. The Company also pays expenses and PPF levies incurred by the Scheme.\n\nAssumptions used The last triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme was performed by an independent professional actuary at 30 April 2018 using the projected unit method of valuation. For the purposes of IAS 19 (revised) the actuarial valuation as at 30 April 2018 has been updated on an approximate basis to 31 March 2019. There have been no changes in the valuation methodology adopted for this year’s disclosures compared to the prior year’s disclosures.\n\nThe principal financial assumptions used to calculate the liabilities under IAS 19 (revised) are as follows:\n\n2019 %\n\n2018 %\n\nDiscount rate for scheme liabilities\n\n2.45\n\n2.60\n\nCPI inflation\n\n2.35\n\n2.25\n\nRPI inflation\n\n3.45\n\n3.35\n\nPension increases\n\nPre 1988 GMP\n\n–\n\n–\n\nPost 1988 GMP\n\n2.10\n\n2.10\n\nPre 2004 non GMP\n\n5.00\n\n5.00\n\nPost 2004\n\n3.35\n\n3.25\n\nThe financial assumptions reflect the nature and term of the Scheme’s liabilities.\n\nThe Group has assumed that mortality will be in line with nationally published mortality table S2NA with CMI 2018 projections related to members’ years of birth with long-term rate of improvement of 1.5% per annum. These tables translate into an average life expectancy for a pensioner retiring at age 65 as follows:\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nMen Years\n\nWomen Years\n\nMen Years\n\nWomen Years\n\nMember aged 65 (current life expectancy)\n\n86.8\n\n88.9\n\n87.3\n\n89.3\n\nMember aged 45 (life expectancy at age 65)\n\n88.5\n\n90.7\n\n89.0\n\n91.1\n\nIt is assumed that 50% of non-retired members of the Scheme will commute the maximum amount of cash at retirement (2018: 50% of non-retired members of the Scheme will commute the maximum amount of cash at retirement).\n\n",

The Company monitors other indices to assure that the pension obligations are fairly reported on a consistent basis. The international discount rates were determined by comparison against country specific AA corporate indices, adjusted for duration of the obligation.\n\nThe periodic benefit cost and the actuarial present value of projected benefit obligations are based on actuarial assumptions that are reviewed on an annual basis. The Company revises these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long- term trends, as well as market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits.\n\n67",

The net increase in the total valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 is primarily related to the increase of a net operating loss carry forward due to a release of a non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefit and the increase of deferred tax assets in sites with existing valuation allowances. The decrease in domestic federal and state tax credits is primarily related to the utilization of tax credits against the one-time transition tax.\n\nAs of August 31, 2019, the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the remaining earnings from its foreign\n\nsubsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not already been recorded. The accumulated earnings are the most significant component of the basis difference which is indefinitely reinvested.",

The Company has significant deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to property, plant and equipment, which are expected to reverse and allow for the full utilization of the NOL carryforward. As such, the Company has not recorded a valuation allowance related to the NOL carryforward. Also included in the deferred tax assets are North Carolina Investing in Business Property Credit and North Carolina Jobs Credits totaling $4.9 million, as well as Georgia Job Tax Credits totaling $2.6 million. The North Carolina Investing in Business Property Credit provides a 7% investment tax credit for property located in a North Carolina development area, the North Carolina Creating Jobs Credit provides a tax credit for increased employment in North Carolina, and the Georgia Job Tax Credit provides a tax credit for creation and retention of qualifying jobs in Georgia. It is management’s opinion that the majority of the North Carolina and Georgia income tax credits will not be utilized before they expire, and a $5.6 million valuation allowance has been recorded as of October 31, 2019. The North Carolina credits began to expire during fiscal 2018, and the remaining credits expire between fiscal years 2020 and 2023.\n\n58\n\n2017\n\n117,611 11,024 128,635\n\n15,452 1,804 (1,106) 16,150 144,785\n\n2018\n\n88,351 1,751 90,102\n\n7,814 2,862 8,280 12,235 654 (11,017) 6,481 27,309 62,793",

As a result of the Act, we recognized an estimated expense of $11.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, of which $9.2 million related to the write- down of deferred tax assets and $2.7 million related to tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings. We calculated our best estimate of the impact of the Act in our 2017 year-end income tax provision in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which was issued to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed to finalize the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act. Additional work to complete a more detailed analysis of historical foreign earnings, as well as the full impact relating to the write-down of deferred tax assets, was completed in the third quarter of 2018 and resulted in a tax benefit of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, non-current deferred taxes related to our investments and our defined benefit pension plan reflect deferred taxes on the net unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments and deferred taxes on unrealized losses in our pension plan. The net change in non-current deferred taxes associated with these items, which resulted in a deferred tax benefit of $0.4 million and $2.8 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, was recorded as an adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss), presented in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\n\n2018\n\n$6,609\n\n2,850\n\n1,122\n\n4,779\n\n3,069\n\n326\n\n5,538\n\n3,097\n\n8,164\n\n17,495\n\n—\n\n—\n\n(5,816)\n\n47,233\n\n(3,515)\n\n(6,531)\n\n—\n\n—\n\n(10,046)\n\n$37,187\n\nFinancial Results 71"

This decrease was due to a $5.2 million decrease in products revenue, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in services revenue. The decrease in products revenue was primarily driven by lower demand from our service provider customers in the Americas. Revenues from service provider customers decreased 10% in 2018 compared to 2017. Revenue from enterprise customers remained relatively constant in 2018 compared to 2017.\n\nProducts revenue decreased $5.2 million, or 3%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by lower demand from our service provider customers in the Americas, as well as decreases from EMEA, offset in part by a $2.6 million increase from the adoption of ASC 606 in 2018 and by the increase in products revenue primarily from Japan and Asia Pacific. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information related to our adoption of ASC 606.\n\nServices revenue increased $2.0 million, or 2%, in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily\n\nattributable to the increase in PCS sales in connection with our increased installed customer base.\n\nDuring 2018, $112.5 million, or 48%, of total revenue was generated from the Americas, which represents a 8% decrease compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower products revenue driven by lower demand from our service providers in the Americas.\n\nDuring 2018, $55.2 million, or 24%, of total revenue was generated from Japan, which represents a 7% increase in revenue compared to 2017. The increase was mainly due to higher product revenues driven by higher demand from our service providers in Japan.\n\nDuring 2018, $36.9 million, or 16%, of total revenue was generated from the Asia Pacific regions excluding Japan, which represents a 11% increase compared to 2017. The increase was driven primarily by higher products revenue as well as higher services revenue from PCS sales in connection with our increased installed customer base.\n\nDuring 2018, $27.6 million, or 12%, of total revenue was generated from EMEA, which remained relatively\n\nconsistent from 2017.\n\nCost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\n\nCost of revenue\n\nCost of products revenue is primarily comprised of cost of third-party manufacturing services and cost of inventory for the hardware component of our products. Cost of products revenue also includes warehouse personnel costs, shipping costs, inventory write-downs, certain allocated facilities and information technology infrastructure costs, and expenses associated with logistics and quality control.\n\nCost of services revenue is primarily comprised of personnel costs for our technical support, training and professional service teams. Cost of services revenue also includes the costs of inventory used to provide hardware replacements to end- customers under PCS contracts and certain allocated facilities and information technology infrastructure costs.\n\nA summary of our cost of revenue is as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nIncrease (Decrease) Percent Amount\n\nCost of revenue:\n\nProducts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The result of this definition is ultimately net cash from operating activities plus payment for purchase and proceeds from sale of tangible, intangible and financial assets, proceeds received in the sale of businesses and cash paid for business acquisitions. We believe Free Cash Flow, a non-U.S. GAAP measure, provides useful information for investors and management because it measures our capacity to generate cash from our operating and investing activities to sustain our operations. Free Cash Flow is not a U.S. GAAP measure and does not represent total cash flow since it does not include the cash flows generated by or used in financing activities.

            "Cash Equivalents\n\nOur cash equivalents consist of bank time deposits. Since these are short-term highly liquid investments with remaining\n\nmaturities of 3 months or less, they present negligible risk of changes in fair value due to changes in interest rates and are Level 1.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n\nOur foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency options, interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps are recorded at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets using a discounted cash flow analysis that incorporates observable market inputs. These market inputs include foreign currency spot and forward rates, and various interest rate curves, and are obtained from pricing data quoted by various banks, third-party sources and foreign currency dealers involving identical or comparable instruments and are Level 2.\n\nCounterparties to these foreign currency forward contracts have at least an investment grade rating. Credit ratings on\n\nsome of our counterparties may change during the term of our financial instruments. We closely monitor our counterparties’ credit ratings and, if necessary, will make any appropriate changes to our financial instruments. The fair value generally reflects the estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date.\n\nForeign currency forward contracts and options are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other\n\ncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\nOther Financial Instruments\n\nThe following financial instruments are recorded at fair value or at amounts that approximate fair value: (1) trade receivables, net, (2) certain other current assets, (3) accounts payable and (4) other current liabilities. The carrying amounts reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the above financial instruments closely approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.\n\nOther liabilities that are recorded at carrying value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets include our credit facilities and\n\nsenior notes. We utilize a market approach to calculate the fair value of our senior notes. Due to their limited investor base and the face value of some of our senior notes, they may not be actively traded on the date we calculate their fair value. Therefore, we may utilize prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving similar securities, reflecting U.S. Treasury yields to calculate the yield to maturity and the price on some of our senior notes. These inputs are provided by an independent third party and are considered to be Level 2 inputs.\n\nWe derive our fair value estimates of our various other debt instruments by evaluating the nature and terms of each instrument, considering prevailing economic and market conditions, and examining the cost of similar debt offered at the balance sheet date. We also incorporated our credit default swap rates and currency specific swap rates in the valuation of each debt instrument, as applicable.\n\nThese estimates are subjective and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment, and therefore we cannot\n\ndetermine them with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect our estimates.\n\nThe table below shows the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our debt, excluding lease liabilities:\n\n110\n\nDecember 31, 2019\n\nDecember 31, 2018\n\n(In millions)\n\nCarrying Amount\n\nFair Value\n\nCarrying Amount\n\nFair Value\n\nTerm Loan A Facility due July 2022 Term Loan A Facility due July 2023(1) 6.50% Senior Notes due December 2020 4.875% Senior Notes due December 2022 5.25% Senior Notes due April 2023 4.50% Senior Notes due September 2023(1) 5.125% Senior Notes due December 2024 5.50% Senior Notes due September 2025 4.00% Senior Notes due December 2027 6.875% Senior Notes due July 2033 Other foreign borrowings(1) Other domestic borrowings Total debt(2)\n\n$\n\n474.6 $ 223.8 — 421.9 422.0 445.6 421.9 397.4 420.4 445.7 12.1 89.0 3,774.4 $\n\n474.6 $ 223.8 — 450.1 454.1 509.5 458.9 441.2 431.5 528.8 12.4 89.0 4,073.9 $\n\n— $\n\n222.2 424.0 421.1 421.2 454.9 421.3 397.1 — 445.5 98.5 168.4 3,474.2 $\n\n— 222.2 440.1 421.2 424.5 489.9 419.8 394.8 — 453.4 99.2 170.0 3,535.1\n\n$\n\n(1)\n\nIncludes borrowings denominated in currencies other than US Dollars.\n\n(2)\n\nAt December 31, 2019, the carrying amount and estimated fair value of debt exclude lease liabilities.\n\nIn addition to the table above, the Company remeasures amounts related to certain equity compensation that are carried at\n\nfair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Financial Statements or for which a fair value measurement was required.

Included among our non-financial assets and liabilities that are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis are inventories, net property and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets and asset retirement obligations.\n\nCredit and Market Risk\n\nFinancial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest or currency exchange rates. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, establishing credit limits, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk.\n\nWe do not expect any of our counterparties in derivative transactions to fail to perform as it is our policy to have counterparties to these contracts that have at least an investment grade rating. Nevertheless, there is a risk that our exposure to losses arising out of derivative contracts could be material if the counterparties to these agreements fail to perform their obligations. We will replace counterparties if a credit downgrade is deemed to increase our risk to unacceptable levels.\n\nWe regularly monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments.\n\nWe continually monitor the creditworthiness of our diverse base of customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business and generally do not require collateral. We consider the concentrations of credit risk associated with our trade accounts receivable to be commercially reasonable and believe that such concentrations do not leave us vulnerable to significant risks of near-term severe adverse impacts. The terms and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. Our sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers.\n\n",

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTThe Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is determined based upon the exit price that would be received to sellan asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, as determined by either the principal market or the most advantageousmarket. Inputs used in the valuation techniques to derive fair values are classified based on a three-level hierarchy, as follows:Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2—Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets with insufficient volumeor infrequent transactions (less active markets), or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from orcorroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3—Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities.The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company’sinvestments are in money market funds, U.S. treasury bonds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, asset-backed securities and corporate debt securities, whichare classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, and were initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued at each reporting date utilizingmarket-observable data. The market-observable data included reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, bids, offers, current spotrates and other industry and economic events.The fair value of these assets measured on a recurring basis was determined using the following inputs as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands): December 31, 2019 QuotedPrices inActiveMarkets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) Total FairValueAssets: Money market funds$— $2,010 $— $2,010U.S. treasury bonds— 116,835 — 116,835Commercial paper— 44,300 — 44,300Certificates of deposit— 24,539 — 24,539Asset-backed securities— 73,499 — 73,499Corporate debt securities— 181,079 — 181,079Total$— $442,262 $— $442,26282"

            "ITEM NO. 2 – RATIFICATION OF KPMG AS OUR 2020 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR\n\nTHE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THIS PROPOSAL\n\nThe Audit Committee of the Board has appointed KPMG LLP as our independent auditor for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020, and we are submitting that appointment to our shareholders for ratification on an advisory basis at the meeting. Although shareholder ratification of KPMG’s appointment is not legally required, we are submitting this matter to the shareholders, as in the past, as a matter of good corporate practice. In determining whether to reappoint KPMG as our independent auditor, the Audit Committee considered a number of factors, including, among others, the firm’s qualifications, industry expertise, prior performance, control procedures, proposed staffing and the reasonableness of its fees on an absolute basis and as compared with fees paid by comparable companies.\n\nIf the shareholders fail to vote on an advisory basis in favor of the appointment, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether to retain KPMG, and may appoint that firm or another without resubmitting the matter to the shareholders. Even if the shareholders ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee may, in its discretion, select a different independent auditor at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the Company’s best interests.\n\nIn connection with the audit of the 2019 financial statements, we entered into an engagement letter with KPMG which sets forth the terms by which KPMG will provide audit services to us. Any future disputes between KPMG and us under that letter will be subject to certain specified alternative dispute resolution procedures, none of which are intended to restrict the remedies that our shareholders might independently pursue against KPMG.\n\nThe following table lists the aggregate fees and costs billed to us by KPMG and its affiliates for the 2018 and 2019 services identified below:\n\nAmount Billed\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nAudit Fees(1)\n\n$16,014,014 $17,639,702\n\nAudit-Related Fees(2)\n\n106,528\n\n153,203\n\nTax Fees(3)\n\n1,318,798\n\n119,098\n\nOther\n\n—\n\n—\n\nTotal Fees\n\n$17,439,340 $17,912,003\n\n(1)\n\nIncludes the cost of services rendered in connection with (i) auditing our annual consolidated financial statements, (ii) auditing our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (iii) reviewing our quarterly financial statements, (iv) auditing the financial statements of several of our subsidiaries, (v) reviewing our registration statements and issuing related comfort letters, (vi) statutory audits for certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and (vii) consultations regarding accounting standards. In addition, the amount listed for 2018 includes a final billing of $785,000 that was received after we finalized our 2019 proxy statement and consequently was not reflected in the auditor fee table included in our 2019 proxy statement.\n\n(2)\n\nIncludes the cost of preparing agreed upon procedures reports and providing general accounting consulting services.\n\n(3)\n\nIncludes costs associated with general tax planning, consultation and compliance (which were approximately $1,300,000 in 2018 and approximately $100,000 in 2019).\n\nThe Audit Committee maintains written procedures that require it to annually review and pre-approve the scope of all services to be performed by our independent auditor. This review includes an evaluation of whether the provision of non-audit services by our independent auditor is compatible with maintaining the auditor’s\n\n",

All of the NOL carryforward was incurred subsequent to the enactment of the TCJA and therefore has an indefinite carryforward period. The Company has significant deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to property, plant and equipment, which are expected to reverse and allow for the full utilization of the NOL carryforward. As such, the Company has not recorded a valuation allowance related to the NOL carryforward. Also included in the deferred tax assets are North Carolina Investing in Business Property Credit and North Carolina Jobs Credits totaling $4.9 million, as well as Georgia Job Tax Credits totaling $2.6 million. The North Carolina Investing in Business Property Credit provides a 7% investment tax credit for property located in a North Carolina development area, the North Carolina Creating Jobs Credit provides a tax credit for increased employment in North Carolina, and the Georgia Job Tax Credit provides a tax credit for creation and retention of qualifying jobs in Georgia. It is management’s opinion that the majority of the North Carolina and Georgia income tax credits will not be utilized before they expire, and a $5.6 million valuation allowance has been recorded as of October 31, 2019.

The additions for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019 and 2018 are primarily related to the impacts of the Tax Act and taxation of certain intercompany transactions. The additions for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 are primarily related to certain non-U.S. net operating loss carry forwards, previously offset with a valuation allowance, that can no longer be recognized due to an internal restructuring. The reductions from settlements with taxing authorities for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 are primarily related to the settlement of a U.S. audit.\n\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax\n\nexpense. The Company’s accrued interest and penalties were approximately $18.9 million and $20.4 million as of August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company recognized interest and penalties of approximately $(1.5) million, $(6.7) million and $5.2 million during the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\nIt is reasonably possible that the August 31, 2019 unrecognized tax benefits could decrease during the next\n\n12 months by $5.8 million, primarily related to a state settlement.\n\n",

All of the NOL carryforward was incurred subsequent to the enactment of the TCJA and therefore has an indefinite carryforward period. The Company has significant deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to property, plant and equipment, which are expected to reverse and allow for the full utilization of the NOL carryforward. As such, the Company has not recorded a valuation allowance related to the NOL carryforward. Also included in the deferred tax assets are North Carolina Investing in Business Property Credit and North Carolina Jobs Credits totaling $4.9 million, as well as Georgia Job Tax Credits totaling $2.6 million. The North Carolina Investing in Business Property Credit provides a 7% investment tax credit for property located in a North Carolina development area, the North Carolina Creating Jobs Credit provides a tax credit for increased employment in North Carolina, and the Georgia Job Tax Credit provides a tax credit for creation and retention of qualifying jobs in Georgia. It is management’s opinion that the majority of the North Carolina and Georgia income tax credits will not be utilized before they expire, and a $5.6 million valuation allowance has been recorded as of October 31, 2019. The North Carolina credits began to expire during fiscal 2018, and the remaining credits expire between fiscal years 2020 and 2023.\n\n58\n\n2017\n\n117,611 11,024 128,635\n\n15,452 1,804 (1,106) 16,150 144,785\n\n2018\n\n88,351 1,751 90,102\n\n7,814 2,862 8,280 12,235 654 (11,017) 6,481 27,309 62,793",
            "Table of Contents\n\nOn June 7, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner upheld U.S. Treasury Department regulations requiring that related parties in a cost-sharing arrangement share expenses related to stock-based compensation in proportion to the economic activity of the parties. The ruling reversed the prior decision of the U.S. Tax Court. On November 12, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the plaintiff’s request for an en banc rehearing. Based on the appellate court’s ruling, the Company recorded a cumulative income tax expense of $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The plaintiff filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court on February 10, 2020, and the Company will continue to monitor developments in this matter.\n\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets were as follows (in thousands):\n\nDecember 31,\n\n2019\n\nDeferred tax assets:\n\nNet operating losses and credits\n\n$\n\n113,475 $\n\nFixed assets and intangible assets\n\n61,932\n\nAccruals and reserves\n\n75,133\n\nStock-based compensation\n\n8,615\n\nInventory\n\n429\n\nOther\n\n5,287\n\nTotal deferred tax assets\n\n264,871\n\nLess: valuation allowance\n\n(244,581)\n\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance\n\n20,290\n\nDeferred tax liabilities:\n\nAccruals and reserves\n\n(15,525)\n\nOther\n\n(914)\n\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n\n(16,439)\n\nNet deferred tax assets\n\n$\n\n3,851 $\n\nThe Company accounts for deferred taxes under ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”) which involves weighing positive and negative evidence concerning the realizability of the Company’s deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction. The Company evaluated its ability to realize the benefit of its net deferred tax assets and weighed all available positive and negative evidence both objective and subjective in nature. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the weight given to positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. Consideration was given to negative evidence such as: the duration and severity of losses in prior years, high seasonal revenue concentrations, increasing competitive pressures, and a challenging retail environment. Realization of the Company’s net deferred tax assets is dependent upon its generation of sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income change.\n\nThe Company recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the net amount that the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has a valuation allowance of $191.7 million against its U.S. deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance of $52.9 million against certain of its foreign deferred tax assets that the Company is not expected to realize. The Company will continue to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets in each of the applicable jurisdictions going forward.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company has U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $316.2 million which expire beginning after 2032, California net operating loss carryforwards of $57.3 million which expire beginning after 2032, and other states net operating loss carryforwards of $52.1 million which expire beginning after 2023. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has U.S. federal research tax credit carryforwards of approximately $22.6 million, which if not utilized, begin to expire after 2031, California research tax credit carryforwards of approximately $45.0 million, which do not expire, Massachusetts research tax credit carryforwards of approximately $2.9 million, which if not utilized, begin to expire after 2028,\n\n98\n\n2018\n\n61,494\n\n55,476\n\n53,818\n\n9,494\n\n911\n\n4,806\n\n185,999\n\n(181,122)\n\n4,877\n\n—\n\n(560)\n\n(560)\n\n"

Providing the Company acts within the requirements and constraints of the regulatory authorities, the renewal and extension of these licenses is reasonably certain at minimal costs. Accordingly, we have concluded that the acquired FCC licenses are indefinite-lived intangible assets.\n\nIn 2019, FCC licenses increased $15.6 million, $18.2 million of which was through acquisitions, offset by $2.3 million of impairments and $0.3 million loss on the sale of licenses. Our Broadcasting segment recorded the impairment as a result of its decision to forfeit FCC licenses in certain lower-ranked markets, and does not expect any significant changes to future cash flows as a result of these forfeitures.

            "Table of Contents\n\nShort-term Investments\n\nCertificates of deposit held for investment with an original maturity greater than 90 days and less than one year are carried at cost and reported as Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The certificates of deposit are not debt securities.\n\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents and trade receivables. The Company currently invests its excess cash in government and prime money market funds. The cash in the Company’s U.S. banks is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to the insurable limit of $250,000.\n\nIncome (Loss) per Share\n\nThe computation of basic net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share includes the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares had been issued. In periods with a net loss, all common stock equivalents are excluded from the per share calculation; therefore, the basic loss per share equals the diluted loss per share.\n\nInventories and Inventory Valuation\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market value. Market value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by estimated costs of disposal. Should actual market conditions differ from the Company’s estimates, the Company’s future results of operations could be materially affected. Reductions in inventory valuation are included in Cost of revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company reviews inventory for excess quantities and obsolescence based on its best estimates of future demand, product lifecycle status and product development plans. The Company uses historical information along with these future estimates to reduce the inventory cost basis. Subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. Prices anticipated for future inventory demand are compared to current and committed inventory values.\n\nThe components of inventories are as follows:\n\nMarch 31,\n\n(in thousands) Raw materials\n\nFinished goods\n\n$\n\n2019\n\n3,445 $ 6,356\n\nTotal inventories\n\n$\n\n9,801 $\n\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets\n\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets generally consist of prepaid product royalty, prepaid maintenance agreements and prepaid rent, which are amortized as expense generally over the term of the underlying contract or estimated product life.\n\nLand, Property and Equipment\n\nLand, property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or for leasehold improvements, the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives for machinery and equipment range from 5 to 7 years and for office, computer and research equipment from 2 to 5 years. Expenditures for major renewals and improvements that extend the useful life of property and equipment are capitalized.\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $0.6 million and $0.8 million for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. In accordance with ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment (ASC 360), the Company assesses all of its long-lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment when impairment indicators are identified. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss may be necessary. An impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset.\n\nThe Company acquired 16 acres of land with an acquisition and sold 4 acres in April 2015 for $264,000. The Company still owns 12 acres of land that remains on the market. The Company concluded that a sale transaction for the remaining land is not probable within the next year; therefore, unsold land is classified as held-and-used as of March 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\n37-\n\n2018\n\n2,969 6,253\n\n9,222\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe components of fixed assets are as follows:\n\nMarch 31,\n\n(in thousands) Land\n\n$\n\n2019\n\n672 $\n\nMachinery and equipment Office, computer and research equipment Leasehold improvements\n\n1,372 5,267 798\n\nLand, property and equipment, gross\n\nLess accumulated depreciation and amortization\n\n$\n\n8,109 $ (6,811 )\n\nLand, property and equipment, net\n\n$\n\n1,298 $\n\nIntangible Assets\n\nIntangible assets with determinable lives are amortized on a straight-line basis or the consumption period based on expected cash flows from the underlying intangible asset over their respective estimated useful lives. If the Company were to determine that a change to the remaining estimated useful life of an intangible asset was necessary, then the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. On an ongoing basis, the Company reviews intangible assets with a definite life and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that carrying values may not be recoverable. If such events or changes in circumstances occur, the Company will recognize an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flow expected to be generated by the asset is less than the carrying value of the related asset. Any impairment loss would adjust the asset to its implied fair value.\n\nSee Note 4, Intangible Assets for further discussion of intangible assets impairment evaluations.\n\nAccrued Expenses\n\nThe components of accrued expenses are as follows:\n\nMarch 31,\n\n(in thousands) Accrued compensation\n\n$\n\n2019\n\n656 $\n\nAccrued contractual obligation Other accrued expenses\n\n1,445 1,466\n\nTotal accrued expenses\n\n$\n\n3,567 $\n\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\n\nThe Company records revenue based on a five-step model in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers (ASC 606). The Company's revenue is derived from the sale of products, software, and services identified in contracts. A contract exists when both parties have an approved agreement that creates enforceable rights and obligations, identifies performance obligations and payment terms and has commercial substance. The Company records revenue from these contracts when control of the products or services transfer to the customer. The amount of revenue to be recognized is based upon the consideration, including the impact of any variable consideration, that the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these products and services.\n\nThe majority of the Company’s revenue is recorded at a point in time from the sale of tangible products. Revenue is recorded when control of the products passes to the customer, dependent upon the terms of the underlying contract. For right-to-use software, revenue is recognized at the point in time the customer has the right to use and can substantially benefit from use of the software. Products regularly include warranties that include bug fixes, and minor updates so that the product continues to function as promised in a dynamic environment, and phone support. These standard warranties are assurance type warranties which do not offer any services beyond the assurance that the product will continue working as specified. Therefore, warranties are not considered separate performance obligations. Instead, the Company accrues the expected cost of warranty. Extended warranties are sold separately with a post contract support (PCS) agreement. PCS revenue is recognized over time during the support period.",

In accordance with ASC 842, the Company determined if an arrangement was a lease at inception based on whetherthere is an identified asset, whether the Company has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset and whether the Companyhas the right to direct the use of the asset. As of December 31, 2019, the Company only has operating leases and does not have any financing leases. Operatinglease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. Leaseexpense for minimum lease payments was recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. See Note 9 for further disclosures regarding the Company’soperating leases.Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”). ASU 2019-12 is intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes by, among other things, eliminating certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod taxallocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences.ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, the Company must apply certainaspects of this standard retrospectively for all periods presented while other aspects are applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effectadjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on itsconsolidated financial statements.In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments(“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 is intended to provide more decision-useful information about expected credit losses on financial instruments and othercommitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The main provisions include presenting financial assets measured at amortized costat the amount expected to be collected, which is net of an allowance for expected credit losses, and recording credit losses related to available-for-sale securitiesthrough an allowance for credit losses. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and must be appliedusing a modified retrospective approach with earlier adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company does not expect theadoption of this amendment to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.4. REVENUEThe Company adopted ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. The Company recognized the cumulative effect ofinitially applying ASC 606, which was immaterial, as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative prior period information isaccounted for in accordance with the previous revenue guidance, ASC 605, and has not been restated. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company recognizesrevenue under the core principle to depict the transfer of control to the Company’s customers in an amount reflecting the consideration the Company expects to beentitled. In order to achieve that core principle, the Company applies the following five step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify theperformance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5)recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.Revenue for product sales is recognized at the point in time when control transfers to the Company’s customers, which is generally when products areshipped from the Company’s manufacturing facilities or when delivered to the customer’s named location. When the Company performs shipping and handlingactivities after the transfer of control to the customer (e.g., when control transfers prior to delivery), they are considered to be fulfillment activities, andaccordingly, the costs are accrued for when the related revenue is recognized. Taxes collected on behalf of customers relating to product sales and remitted togovernmental authorities, principally sales taxes, are excluded from revenue.",
            "Contingencies\n\nWe evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with\n\nthe authoritative guidance on contingencies. We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes from potential claims or proceedings, as well as potential ranges of probable losses, when the outcomes of the claims or proceedings are probable and reasonably estimable. A determination of the amount of an accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after the analysis of each separate matter. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, we base our estimates on the information available at the time of our assessment. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates.\n\nNote 2. Recent Accounting Standards\n\nRecently adopted authoritative guidance\n\nRevenue Recognition — Contracts with Customers. In May 2014, the FASB issued new authoritative guidance for revenue from contracts with customers. The standard’s core principle is that a company recognizes revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, companies are required to capitalize certain contract acquisition costs, including commissions paid, when contracts are signed. The asset recognized from capitalized incremental and recoverable acquisition costs is amortized on a straight-line basis consistent with the timing of transfer of the products or services to which the asset relates.\n\nAs a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance, our net revenue for fiscal\n\n2019 increased $47 million, and our operating expenses decreased $12 million. See Note 3 for additional information related to the impact of the new guidance on the timing and amounts of revenues recognized in fiscal 2019.\n\nThe effects of the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance on our March 29, 2019\n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:\n\n(In millions)\n\nAs Reported\n\nAs of March 29, 2019 Balances Without Adoption of New Standard\n\nEffect of Change\n\nAccounts receivable, net Other current assets (1) Other long-term assets (2) Total assets\n\n$ $ $ $\n\n708 435 1,262 15,938\n\n$ $ $ $\n\n657 421 1,213 15,824\n\n$ $ $ $\n\n51 14 49 114\n\nShort-term contract liabilities Other current liabilities Long-term contract liabilities Deferred income tax liabilities Total liabilities\n\n$ $ $ $ $\n\n2,320 533 736 577 10,200\n\n$ $ $ $ $\n\n2,437 494 837 526 10,328\n\n$ $ $ $ $\n\n(117) 39 (101) 51 (128)\n\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss Retained earnings Total stockholders’ equity\n\n$ $ $\n\n(7) $ $ $\n\n933 5,738\n\n(2) $ $ $\n\n686 5,496\n\n(5) 247 242\n\n(1)\n\nAs reported includes short-term deferred commissions of $92 million.

As necessary, we fund any incremental amounts for our estimated collection and recycling obligations on an annual basis based on the estimated costs of collecting and recycling covered modules, estimated rates of return on our restricted investments, and an estimated solar module life of 25 years less amounts already funded in prior years. To ensure that amounts previously funded will be available in the future regardless of potential adverse changes in our financial condition (even in the case of our own insolvency), we have established a trust under which estimated funds are put into custodial accounts with an established and reputable bank, for which First Solar, Inc.; First Solar Malaysia Sdn.

Sharp order growth in Asia, Australia included two large orders for offshore wind-farms in- cluding service in Taiwan totaling € 2.3 billion. SGRE also re- corded sharply higher orders in the Americas region, driven by several large orders in the onshore business mainly in the U. S. In contrast, orders came in substantially lower in the region Europe, C. I. S., Africa, Middle East which in the prior year had included an order for an offshore wind-farm, including service, in the U. K. worth € 1.3 billion. Revenue was up significantly year-over-year, with substantial growth in the offshore and service businesses and clear growth in the onshore business. On a geographic basis, revenue rose substantially in Europe, C. I. S., Africa, Middle East, while it declined clearly in the other two reporting regions. Adjusted EBITA was on the prior-year level as positive effects from productivity improvements and higher revenue were offset by price declines, a less favorable project mix and higher ex- penses for integration costs and capacity adjustments including severance. Severance charges were € 32 million in fiscal 2019 and € 77 million in fiscal 2018. SGRE’s order backlog was € 26 billion at end of the fiscal year, of which € 9 billion are expected to be con- verted into revenue in fiscal 2020.\n\nThese results were achieved in markets that grew substantially in fiscal 2019 in terms of installed capacity due to higher demand in both the onshore and offshore markets, with the latter grow- ing faster. Market volume in euros was subject to adverse price development. On a regional basis, growth in the onshore busi- ness was again driven primarily by China where the largest na- tional wind market in the world for onshore generation remains largely closed to foreign manufacturers, and secondarily by the U. S. In contrast, the onshore market in Germany declined signifi- cantly. In the offshore market, growth was driven by the U. K. and China. SGRE expects global onshore wind installations to grow\n\nCombined Management Report\n\nclearly in fiscal 2020, driven by growth in the U. S. and India. Global offshore wind power markets are expected to grow in fiscal 2020. The driver of this growth is China which offsets a slight decline in European markets. Market volume in euros is expected to be sub- ject to adverse price development in the offshore business, reflect- ing the trends discussed above, and currency translation effects.\n\nA.3.8 Financial Services\n\nFinancial Services supports its customers’ investments with leas- ing solutions and equipment, project and structured financing in the form of debt and equity investments.

            "At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our restricted investments consisted of long-term marketable securities that were also held in custodial accounts to fund the estimated future costs of collecting and recycling modules covered under our solar module collection and recycling program. As necessary, we fund any incremental amounts for our estimated collection and recycling obligations on an annual basis based on the estimated costs of collecting and recycling covered modules, estimated rates of return on our restricted investments, and an estimated solar module life of 25 years less amounts already funded in prior years. To ensure that amounts previously funded will be available in the future regardless of potential adverse changes in our financial condition (even in the case of our own insolvency), we have established a trust under which estimated funds are put into custodial accounts with an established and reputable bank, for which First Solar, Inc.; First Solar Malaysia Sdn. Bhd.; and First Solar Manufacturing GmbH are grantors. Trust funds may be disbursed for qualified module collection and recycling costs (including capital and facility related recycling costs), payments to customers for assuming collection and recycling obligations, and reimbursements of any overfunded amounts. Investments in the trust must meet certain investment quality criteria comparable to highly rated government or agency bonds.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold certain restricted investments for proceeds of $281.6 million and realized gains of $40.6 million on such sales as part of efforts to align the currencies of the investments with those of the corresponding collection and recycling liabilities and disburse $22.2 million of overfunded amounts. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold certain restricted investments for proceeds of $231.1 million and realized gains of $55.4 million on such sales as part of an effort to align the currencies of the investments with those corresponding collection and recycling liabilities and disburse $143.1 million of overfunded amounts.

The unrealized losses were primarily due to increases in interest rates relative to rates at the time of purchase. Based on the underlying credit quality of the investments, we generally hold such securities until we recover our cost basis.

We also present Free Cash Flow, which is a non-U.S. GAAP measure, defined as (i) net cash from operating activities plus (ii) net cash used in investing activities, excluding payment for purchases (and proceeds from the sale) of marketable securities, and net cash variation for joint ventures deconsolidation, which are considered as temporary financial investments. The result of this definition is ultimately net cash from operating activities plus payment for purchase and proceeds from sale of tangible, intangible and financial assets, proceeds received in the sale of businesses and cash paid for business acquisitions. We believe Free Cash Flow, a non-U.S. GAAP measure, provides useful information for investors and management because it measures our capacity to generate cash from our operating and investing activities to sustain our operations. Free Cash Flow is not a U.S. GAAP measure and does not represent total cash flow since it does not include the cash flows generated by or used in financing activities. Free Cash Flow reconciles with the total cash flow and the net cash increase (decrease) by including the payment for purchases (and proceeds from the sale) of marketable securities and net cash variation from joint ventures deconsolidation, the net cash from (used in) financing activities and the effect of changes in exchange rates. In addition, our definition of Free Cash Flow may differ from definitions used by other companies. Free Cash Flow is determined from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as follows:\n\n2019\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 (In millions)\n\n2017\n\nNet cash from operating activities Net cash used in investing activities Excluding: Payment for purchase and proceeds from sale of marketable securities, and net cash variation for joint ventures deconsolidation Payment for purchase and proceeds from sale of tangible and intangible assets, payment for business acquisitions(1) Free Cash Flow (non-U.S. GAAP measure)\n\n$\n\n$\n\n1,869 $ (1,172)\n\n(200)\n\n(1,372) 497 $\n\n1,845 $ (1,212)\n\n(100)\n\n(1,312) 533 $\n\n1,677 (1,468)\n\n99\n\n(1,369) 308\n\n(1)\n\nReflects the total of the following line items reconciled with our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows relating to the investing activities: Payment for purchase of tangible assets, Proceeds from sale of tangible assets, Payment for purchase of intangible assets, Payment for purchase of financial assets, Proceeds from sale of financial assets, Payment for disposal of equity investment, Proceeds received in sale of businesses, Payment for business acquisitions, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired.\n\nFree Cash Flow was positive $497 million in 2019, compared to positive $533 million and positive $308\n\nmillion in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\n59",

We deleveraged during the second half of 2019 and remain committed to a target leverage profile consistent with a mid to high single A credit rating within a couple of years.\n\nOn July 9, 2019, we closed the acquisition of Red Hat for cash consideration of $34.8 billion. The transaction was funded through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from debt issuances. In order to reduce this debt and return to target leverage ratios within a couple of years, we suspended our share repurchase program at the time of the Red Hat acquisition closing. In the second half of 2019, we reduced debt levels by $10.1 billion. Refer to note P, “Borrowings,” for additional details of financing this transaction.\n\nThe indenture governing our debt securities and our various credit facilities each contain significant covenants which obligate the company to promptly pay principal and interest, limit the aggregate amount of secured indebtedness and sale and leaseback transactions to 10 percent of IBM’s consolidated net tangible assets, and restrict our ability to merge or consolidate unless certain conditions are met. The credit facilities also include a covenant on our consolidated net interest expense ratio, which cannot be less than 2.20 to 1.0, as well as a cross default provision with respect to other defaulted indebtedness of at least $500 million.\n\nWe are in compliance with all of our significant debt covenants and provide periodic certification to our lenders. The failure to comply with debt covenants could constitute an event of default with respect to our debt to which such provisions apply. If certain events of default were to occur, the principal and interest on the debt to which such event of default applied would become immediately due and payable.\n\nWe do not have “ratings trigger” provisions in our debt covenants or documentation, which would allow the holders to declare an event of default and seek to accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating. Our contractual agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the agreement if IBM’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade. At December 31, 2019, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was $673 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of the company’s outstanding instruments and market conditions. We have no other contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would result in a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity.\n\nIn July 2017, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. Various central bank committees and working groups continue to discuss replacement of benchmark rates, the process for amending existing LIBOR-based contracts, and the potential economic impacts of different alternatives. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred alternative rate for USD LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. We are evaluating the potential impact of the replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, including risk management, internal operational readiness and monitoring the FASB standard-setting process to address financial reporting issues that might arise in connection with transition from LIBOR to a new benchmark rate.\n\nWe prepare our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with applicable accounting standards for cash flow presentation on page 71 and highlight causes and events underlying sources and uses of cash in that format on page 45. For the purpose of running its business, IBM manages, monitors and analyzes cash flows in a different format.\n\nManagement uses free cash flow as a measure to evaluate its operating results, plan share repurchase levels, strategic investments and assess its ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. We define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and net cash from operating activities that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables. Free cash flow guidance is derived using an estimate of profit, working capital and operational cash flows. Since we view Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment which we seek to maximize, it is not considered when formulating guidance for free cash flow. As a result, we do not estimate a GAAP Net Cash from Operations expectation metric.",

Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, consisting of net loss of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $26.2 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $16.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $10.0 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an outflow from the changes in accrued liabilities and other of $5.9 million and inventory of $5.6 million, partially offset by an inflow from changes in deferred revenue of $3.2 million.\n\nThe unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and other was driven by an increase in lease liabilities associated with the lease of the San Jose corporate office. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to build up of inventory and timing of shipments, partially offset by increased reserves. The favorable change in deferred revenues was primarily driven by increased bookings.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million, consisting of net loss of $27.6 million which includes payments for our internal investigation costs of $8.6 million, non-cash charges of $25.0 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.9 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $3.1 million, offset primarily by an outflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $6.1 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and inventory of $1.5 million.\n\nThe favorable change in deferred revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the sale of subscription and support. The favorable change in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, increased value added tax accrual due to timing of payments, and an increase in legal fees accrual. The unfavorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections. The unfavorable change in prepaid and other assets was mainly driven by the increase in deferred sales commissions due to higher deferred revenue and higher average commission rate. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to the timing of shipments.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $14.3 million, consisting of a net loss of $10.8 million, a cash decrease resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million and non-cash charges of $26.4 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $17.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance of $1.1 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $12.4 million and deferred revenue of $3.0 million, and an outflow from the change in accrued liabilities of $8.9 million, inventory of $4.7 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and accounts payable of $0.9 million.\n\n"

Volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was flat in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior-year period. This result reflected merchandising changes and price elasticity-related declines in certain brands, as well as isolated production challenges, partially offset by the continued benefit from momentum and innovation successes in the snacks businesses. Price/ mix was flat compared to the prior year as unfavorable mix, coupled with increases in brand building investments with retailers were offset by the impact of higher pricing. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC, which was completed in October 2017, contributed $41.3 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 results included $115.9 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $156.4 million of net sales related to this divested business.\n\nRefrigerated & Frozen net sales for fiscal 2019 were $2.80 billion, an increase of $51.0 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 1% increase in volume compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales volumes was a result of innovation across multiple brands, which was partially offset by the effects of reduced merchandising spend and the impact of a recall during the fourth quarter. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2018, as continued delivery of top-line accretive innovation in several brands was partially offset by brand building investments with retailers. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business, which was completed in February 2018, contributed $25.7 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition.\n\nInternational net sales for fiscal 2019 were $793.4 million, a decrease of $50.1 million, or 6%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 2% increase in volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, a 4% decrease due to foreign exchange rates, and a 2% increase in price/mix, in each case compared to fiscal 2018. The volume and price/ mix increases for fiscal 2019 were driven by growth in the Canadian snacks and frozen businesses. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $3.7 million to International net sales for fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 included $4.1 million of net sales related to our Del Monte® processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada, which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $48.9 million of net sales related to this divested business. In addition, fiscal 2019 and 2018 results included $17.1 million and $24.5 million, respectively, related to our divested Wesson® oil business.\n\nFoodservice net sales for fiscal 2019 were $934.2 million, a decrease of $120.6 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 14% decrease in volume, excluding divestitures. The decline in volume reflected the continued execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy and the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Price/mix increased 5% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in price/mix for fiscal 2019 reflected favorable product and customer mix, the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing, and the execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy. Fiscal 2019 included $34.2 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $53.4 million of net sales related to this divested business. Net sales declined by approximately 7% in fiscal 2019 due to the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility.\n\nPinnacle Foods net sales for fiscal 2019 (reflecting 213 days of Conagra Brands ownership) were $1.73 billion. Results reflected expected consumption declines as the Company executes its value-over-volume strategy within the Pinnacle portfolio.\n\n26\n\n% Inc (Dec)\n\n— %\n\n2 %\n\n(6)%\n\n(11)%\n\n100 %\n\n"

The additions for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019 and 2018 are primarily related to the impacts of the Tax Act and taxation of certain intercompany transactions. The additions for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 are primarily related to certain non-U.S. net operating loss carry forwards, previously offset with a valuation allowance, that can no longer be recognized due to an internal restructuring.

All of the NOL carryforward was incurred subsequent to the enactment of the TCJA and therefore has an indefinite carryforward period. The Company has significant deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to property, plant and equipment, which are expected to reverse and allow for the full utilization of the NOL carryforward. As such, the Company has not recorded a valuation allowance related to the NOL carryforward. Also included in the deferred tax assets are North Carolina Investing in Business Property Credit and North Carolina Jobs Credits totaling $4.9 million, as well as Georgia Job Tax Credits totaling $2.6 million. The North Carolina Investing in Business Property Credit provides a 7% investment tax credit for property located in a North Carolina development area, the North Carolina Creating Jobs Credit provides a tax credit for increased employment in North Carolina, and the Georgia Job Tax Credit provides a tax credit for creation and retention of qualifying jobs in Georgia. It is management’s opinion that the majority of the North Carolina and Georgia income tax credits will not be utilized before they expire, and a $5.6 million valuation allowance has been recorded as of October 31, 2019.

Volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was flat in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior-year period. This result reflected merchandising changes and price elasticity-related declines in certain brands, as well as isolated production challenges, partially offset by the continued benefit from momentum and innovation successes in the snacks businesses. Price/ mix was flat compared to the prior year as unfavorable mix, coupled with increases in brand building investments with retailers were offset by the impact of higher pricing. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC, which was completed in October 2017, contributed $41.3 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 results included $115.9 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.

Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 1% increase in volume compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales volumes was a result of innovation across multiple brands, which was partially offset by the effects of reduced merchandising spend and the impact of a recall during the fourth quarter. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2018, as continued delivery of top-line accretive innovation in several brands was partially offset by brand building investments with retailers. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business, which was completed in February 2018, contributed $25.7 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition.\n\nInternational net sales for fiscal 2019 were $793.4 million, a decrease of $50.1 million, or 6%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 2% increase in volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, a 4% decrease due to foreign exchange rates, and a 2% increase in price/mix, in each case compared to fiscal 2018. The volume and price/ mix increases for fiscal 2019 were driven by growth in the Canadian snacks and frozen businesses. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $3.7 million to International net sales for fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 included $4.1 million of net sales related to our Del Monte® processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada, which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $48.9 million of net sales related to this divested business. In addition, fiscal 2019 and 2018 results included $17.1 million and $24.5 million, respectively, related to our divested Wesson® oil business.\n\nFoodservice net sales for fiscal 2019 were $934.2 million, a decrease of $120.6 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 14% decrease in volume, excluding divestitures. The decline in volume reflected the continued execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy and the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Price/mix increased 5% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in price/mix for fiscal 2019 reflected favorable product and customer mix, the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing, and the execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy. Fiscal 2019 included $34.2 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $53.4 million of net sales related to this divested business. Net sales declined by approximately 7% in fiscal 2019 due to the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility.\n\nPinnacle Foods net sales for fiscal 2019 (reflecting 213 days of Conagra Brands ownership) were $1.73 billion.

No shares were considered antidilutive for the year ended September 30, 2017.\n\nUse of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, related revenues and expenses and disclosure about contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Significant estimates include the rebates related to revenue recognition, stock based compensation and the valuation of inventory, long-lived assets, finite lived intangible assets and goodwill. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements: In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. There have been further amendments, including practical expedients, with the issuance of ASU 2018-01 in January 2018, ASU 2018-11 in July 2018 and ASU 2018-20 in December 2018. The amended guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those reporting periods, with early adoption permitted. The guidance will be applied on a modified retrospective basis with the earliest period presented. Based on the effective date, this guidance will apply beginning October 1, 2019. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have no impact to retained earnings or net income. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02 on October 1, 2019, we anticipate recording a right-of-use asset and an offsetting lease liability of approximately $2.3 to $2.9 million.\n\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 Intangibles-Goodwill, which offers amended guidance to simplify the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. A goodwill impairment will now be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This guidance is to be applied on a prospective basis effective for the Company’s interim and annual periods beginning after January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted for any impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. The Company does not believe the adoption of this ASU will have a material impact on our financial statements.\n\n36\n\n2017 3,847,839 13,532,375 128,431 13,660,806\n\n0.28 0.",

            "Table of Contents\n\nThe $16.9 million increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to a $15.5 million increase in personnel costs associated with higheraverage headcount in fiscal year 2019 driven by the Cyence acquisition, as well as a $2.6 million increase in web hosting costs incurred in order to support thedevelopment of our new products including our subscription offerings, to enhance our existing products, and to migrate our products to the cloud, partially offsetby a decrease of $1.2 million in professional services costs.Our research and development headcount was 724 as of July 31, 2019 compared with 749 as of July 31, 2018. Average headcount during fiscal year 2019,however, increased by 54 as compared to average headcount during fiscal year 2018, primarily due to the Cyence acquisition that closed on November 1, 2017,which resulted in increased personnel costs, despite the decrease in headcount as of the end of fiscal year 2019 versus the end of fiscal year 2018.We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to hire and dedicate internal resources to developing,improving, and expanding the functionality of our solutions and migrating our solutions to the cloud. Research and development expenses may also increase if wepursue additional acquisitions.Sales and MarketingOur sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for our sales and marketing employees. It also includes travel expenses, professionalservices for marketing activities, and amortization of certain acquired intangibles.The $6.6 million increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to increases of $14.2 million in personnel expenses due to higher headcount tosell our products and $1.4 million due to the amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease of $9.4 million due to the change in accounting forcommission costs under ASC 606.

Professional services were higher in the prior year period as a result of professional services incurred in connection with our acquisition of Cyence andimplementation costs of a new enterprise resource planning platform and a new product configuration and quoting system.Our general and administrative headcount was 298 as of July 31, 2019 compared with 255 as of July 31, 2018.

All gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. In addition the Group employs Net Investment Hedge Accounting in order to mitigate these impacts where appropriate.\n\nTransactional (or non-structural) exposures give rise to net currency gains and losses that are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. Such exposures include the monetary assets and monetary liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position that are not denominated in the operating (or functional) currency of the operating unit involved. At 31st December 2019 the currency exposures in respect of the euro was a net monetary liability of £184.6m (2018: £191.1m net monetary liability) and in respect of the US dollar a net monetary liability of £0.2m (2018: net monetary liability £40.5m).\n\nAt 31st December 2019, the percentage of debt to net assets, excluding debt was 20% (2018: 29%) for the euro, 1% (2018: 5%) for the US dollar and nil (2018: 1%) for the Chinese renminbi.\n\n193",

            "We only include amounts representing contract change orders, claims or other items in the contract value when we believe the rights and obligations become enforceable. Contract modifications routinely occur to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. In most cases, contract modifications are for goods or services that are not distinct and, therefore, are accounted for as part of the existing contract. Transaction price estimates include additional consideration for submitted contract modifications or claims when we believe there is an enforceable right to the modification or claim, the amount can be reliably estimated, and its realization is reasonably assured. Amounts representing modifications accounted for as part of the existing contract are included in the transaction price and recognized as an adjustment to sales on a cumulative catch-up basis.\n\nIn addition, we are subject to audits of incurred costs related to many of our U.S. government contracts. These audits could produce different results than we have estimated for revenue recognized on our cost-based contracts with the U.S. government; however, our experience has been that our costs are acceptable to the government.\n\nContract Estimates\n\nUse of the cost-to-cost or other similar methods of revenue recognition requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the revenue and cost associated with the design, manufacture and delivery of our products and services. Revisions or adjustments to estimates of the transaction price, estimated costs at completion and estimated profit or loss of a performance obligation are often required as work progresses under a contract, as experience is gained, as facts and circumstances change and as new information is obtained, even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change. In determining the estimated costs at completion, we have to make assumptions regarding labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, estimated increases in wages and prices for materials, performance by our subcontractors, and the availability and timing of funding from our customer, among other variables. Revisions or adjustments to our estimated transaction price and estimated costs at completion may also be required if contract modifications occur. The revisions in contract estimates, if significant, can materially affect our results of operations and cash flows, and in some cases result in liabilities to complete contracts in a loss position. Based upon our history, we believe we have the ability to make reasonable estimates for these items. We have accounting policies and controls in place to address these, as well as other contractual and business arrangements to properly account for long-term contracts, and we continue to monitor and improve such policies, controls, and arrangements. For other information on such policies, controls and arrangements, see our discussion in Item 9A of this Form 10-K.\n\nProducts and services provided under long-term, fixed-price contracts represented approximately 97% of our sales for 2019. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if our underlying circumstances were to change. For example, if underlying assumptions were to change such that our estimated profit rate at completion for all fixed-price contracts accounted for under the cost-to-cost percentage-of-completion method was higher or lower by one percentage point, our 2019 operating income would have increased or decreased by approximately $6.5 million. When adjustments in estimated contract revenues or estimated costs at completion are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized by recording adjustments in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of the changes on current and prior periods using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period the loss is determined.\n\nThe aggregate impact of net changes in contract estimates are presented in the table below (amounts in thousands).\n\nOperating income (loss) Net income (loss) from continuing operations Diluted earnings per share\n\nYears Ended September 30, 2018\n\n2019\n\n$ (2,235) $ (6,986) $ (5,146) (0.19)\n\n(2,351) (0.08)\n\n2017 5,737 3,208 0.12\n\n",

From time to time, the Company may audit or otherwise dispute royalties reported from licensees. Any adjusted royalty revenue as a result of such audits or dispute is recorded by the Company in the period in which such adjustment is agreed to by the Company and the licensee or otherwise determined.\n\nRevenue from the Company’s patent licensing business is generated from negotiated license agreements. The timing and amount of revenue recognized from each licensee depends upon a variety of factors, including the terms of each agreement and the nature of the obligations of the parties. These agreements may include, but not be limited to, elements related to past infringement liabilities, non-refundable upfront license fees, and ongoing royalties on licensed products sold by the licensee. Generally, in the event of settlement of litigation related to the Company’s assertion of patent infringement involving its intellectual property, defendants will either pay (i) a non-refundable lump sum payment for a non-exclusive fully-paid license (a “Fully-Paid License”), or (ii) a non-refundable lump sum payment (license initiation fee) together with an ongoing obligation to pay quarterly or monthly royalties to the Company for the life of the licensed patent (a “Royalty Bearing License”).\n\nThe Company’s license agreements, both Fully-Paid Licenses and Royalty Bearing Licenses, typically include some combination of the following: (i) the grant of a non- exclusive license to manufacture and/or sell products covered by its patented technologies; (ii) the release of the licensee from certain claims, and (iii) the dismissal of any pending litigation. The intellectual property rights granted pursuant to these licenses typically extend until the expiration of the related patents. Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, the Company typically has no further performance obligations with respect to the grant of the non-exclusive licenses. Generally, the license agreements provide for the grant of the licenses, releases, and other obligations following execution of the agreement and the receipt of the up-front lump sum payment for a Fully-Paid License or a license initiation fee for a Royalty Bearing License.\n\nOngoing Royalty Payments: Certain of the Company’s revenue from Royalty Bearing Licenses results from the calculation of royalties based on a licensee’s actual quarterly sales (one licensee pays monthly royalties) of licensed products, applied to a contractual royalty rate. Licensees that pay royalties on a quarterly basis generally report to the Company actual quarterly sales and related quarterly royalties due within 45 days after the end of the quarter in which such sales activity takes place. Licensees with Royalty Bearing Licenses are obligated to provide the Company with quarterly (or monthly) royalty reports that summarize their sales of licensed products and their related royalty obligations to the Company. The Company receives these royalty reports subsequent to the period in which its licensees underlying sales occurred. The amount of royalties due under Royalty Bearing Licenses, each quarter, cannot be reasonably estimated by management.\n\nConsequently, the Company recognizes revenue for the period in which the royalty report is received in arrears and other revenue recognition criteria are met.\n\n"

Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, consisting of net loss of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $26.2 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $16.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $10.0 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an outflow from the changes in accrued liabilities and other of $5.9 million and inventory of $5.6 million, partially offset by an inflow from changes in deferred revenue of $3.2 million.\n\nThe unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and other was driven by an increase in lease liabilities associated with the lease of the San Jose corporate office. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to build up of inventory and timing of shipments, partially offset by increased reserves. The favorable change in deferred revenues was primarily driven by increased bookings.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million, consisting of net loss of $27.6 million which includes payments for our internal investigation costs of $8.6 million, non-cash charges of $25.0 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.9 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $3.1 million, offset primarily by an outflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $6.1 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and inventory of $1.5 million.\n\nThe favorable change in deferred revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the sale of subscription and support. The favorable change in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, increased value added tax accrual due to timing of payments, and an increase in legal fees accrual. The unfavorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections. The unfavorable change in prepaid and other assets was mainly driven by the increase in deferred sales commissions due to higher deferred revenue and higher average commission rate. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to the timing of shipments.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $14.3 million, consisting of a net loss of $10.8 million, a cash decrease resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million and non-cash charges of $26.4 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $17.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance of $1.1 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $12.4 million and deferred revenue of $3.0 million, and an outflow from the change in accrued liabilities of $8.9 million, inventory of $4.7 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and accounts payable of $0.9 million.\n\n",
            "General and administrative expensesGeneral and administrative expenses increased $9.1 million in the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the year ended March 31, 2017, which wasprimarily attributable to increases in personnel-related costs of $5.0 million, share-based compensation expense of $1.2 million, information technology andfacilities costs of $1.0 million and professional services costs and material supplies of $0.6 million each. General and administrative expenses for the yearended March 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2017 were negatively impacted by approximately $0.3 million primarily as a result of theweakening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and South African rand. Personnel-related costs increased primarily as a result of salaries and benefitsassociated with increased headcount. Share-based compensation expense increased primarily as a result of share option grants since the prior year.Information technology and facility and material supplies costs increased primarily as a result of increased headcount.Restructuring and Impairment of long-lived assetsIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, upon the exit of our Watertown, Massachusetts corporate office space, we recorded a restructuring charge of $0.8million for remaining non-cancelable rent and estimated operating expenses for the vacated premises, net of sublease rentals, and a non-cash impairmentcharge of $1.7 million primarily related to leasehold improvements.Other income (expense) Year ended March 31, Period-to-period change 2018 2017 Amount % Change (dollars in thousands) Other income (expense): Interest income $1,310 $510 $800 157%Interest expense (598) (268) (330) 123%Foreign exchange (expense) income and other, net (3,439) 6,892 (10,331) nm Total other income (expense), net $(2,727) $7,134 $(9,861) nm nm—not meaningful Other income (expense), net changed $9.9 million in the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the year ended March 31, 2017, which was primarilyattributable to a change of $10.4 million in foreign exchange expense which was primarily attributable to the re-measurement of short-term intercompanybalances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our operating units.

Actual performance, as measured at the time and prior to the restatement of the 2016 financial statements, resulted in participants achieving 80% of target. Given the PSUs did not contain explicit or implicit claw back rights, there was no change to stock-based compensation expense for the impact of the previously disclosed restatement of the 2016 consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2019, 253,203 shares had vested, 200,297 shares had been forfeited, and the remaining 93,500 shares will vest (as to 80%) in annual tranches through February 2020 subject to continued service vesting requirements.\n\nIn October 2018, we granted 464,888 PSUs with certain financial targets. These PSUs will become eligible to vest at 75% upon the achievement of the performance targets by December 31, 2020, and are subject to service condition vesting requirements. The remaining 25% of these PSUs will become eligible to vest on the first anniversary of the initial vesting date. None of these PSUs were vested as of December 31, 2019.\n\nIn April 2019, we granted 346,453 PSUs with certain financial targets.

None of these PSUs were vested as of December 31, 2019.\n\nIn December 2019, we granted 375,000 PSUs with certain market performance-based targets to be achieved between December 2019 and December 2023. One-third of each tranche of these PSUs will become eligible to vest on each of the three anniversaries of the date the performance-based target is achieved, subject to continued service vesting requirements. The grant date fair values of each tranche of these PSUs were estimated to be $4.59, $4.06 and $3.59 and determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model with the following assumptions: expected term of 4.0 years, expected volatility of 38.45%, risk-free interest rate of 1.7% and expected dividend yield of 0.0%.

In connection with the adoption of ASC 606, we recorded an adjustment to retained earnings to reduce deferred revenue by $2.8 billion. We recognized approximately $9.6 billion of revenue during fiscal 2019 that was included in the deferred revenue balance at July 29, 2018.\n\n(c) Remaining Performance Obligations\n\nRemaining Performance Obligations (RPO) are comprised of deferred revenue plus unbilled contract revenue. As of July 27, 2019, the aggregate amount of RPO was $25.3 billion, comprised of $18.5 billion of deferred revenue and $6.8 billion of unbilled contract revenue. We expect approximately 56% of this amount to be recognized as revenue over the next year. Unbilled contract revenue represents non-cancelable contracts for which we have not invoiced, have an obligation to perform, and revenue has not yet been recognized in the financial statements.\n\n(d) Capitalized Contract Acquisition Costs\n\nIn connection with the adoption of ASC 606, we began to capitalize direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire contracts, primarily sales commissions, for which the associated revenue is expected to be recognized in future periods. We incur these costs in connection with both initial contracts and renewals. These costs are initially deferred and typically amortized over the term of the customer contract which corresponds to the period of benefit. Deferred sales commissions were $750 million as of July 27, 2019, and was included in other current assets and other assets.

Unrecognized tax benefits of $246 million, including penalties, interest and indirect benefits, would affect our provision for income taxes if recognized. As a result of U.S. tax reform, we recorded provisional gross unrecognized tax benefits of $114 million during fiscal 2018.\n\nWe recognized a benefit for adjustments to accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision of approximately $4 million in fiscal 2019 and expense of $5 million in each of fiscal 2018 and 2017.

During fiscal 2019, we recognized a tax benefit of $48 million attributable to the effective settlement and the release of related tax reserves.\n\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was enacted into law. The TCJA made significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the imposition of a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign earnings, and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires companies to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment. However, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the TCJA enactment date.\n\nAs a result of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate change, effective as of January 1, 2018, we remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future periods. During fiscal 2018, we recorded $108 million of tax expense related to all tax rate changes. Upon finalization of our provisional estimates during the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we recorded tax expense of $6 million related to deferred tax assets for equity-based compensation awards to our executives.\n\nThe TCJA imposes a mandatory, one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and profits not previously subject to U.S.\n\nincome tax at a rate of 15.5% on earnings to the extent of foreign cash and other liquid assets, and 8% on the remaining earnings. In fiscal 2018, we recorded a $732 million discrete tax expense for the estimated U.S. federal and state income tax impacts of the transition tax. In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we finalized our computation of the transition tax and recorded a reduction of $5 million to our provisional estimate.\n\nAs of April 26, 2019, we have completed the accounting for the tax impacts of the TCJA, however, we will continue to assess the impact of further guidance from federal and state tax authorities on our business and consolidated financial statements, and recognize any adjustments in the period in which they are determined.\n\nUnder the TCJA, the global minimum tax on intangible income (GMT) provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a\n\ndeemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. Under U.S. GAAP, companies are allowed to make an accounting policy election to either (i) account for GMT as a component of tax expense in the period in which a company is subject to the rules, or (ii) account for GMT in a company’s measurement of deferred taxes. We have elected to recognize the GMT as a period cost and thus recorded $22 million of tax expense for federal and state impacts for fiscal 2019.\n\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued an ASU which eliminates the deferred tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers other than\n\ninventory. As a result, tax expense from the sale of an asset in the seller’s tax jurisdiction is recognized when the transfer occurs, even though the pre-tax effects of that transaction are eliminated in consolidation.\n\nDuring fiscal 2017, we adopted a new accounting standard that simplifies stock-based compensation income tax accounting and presentation within the financial statements and recorded a tax charge of $18 million following the post-adoption rules which require that all excess tax benefits and deficiencies from stock-based compensation be recognized as a component of income tax expense.\n\n80\n\nThe components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions):\n\nApril 26, 2019\n\nApril 27, 2018\n\nDeferred tax assets:\n\nReserves and accruals Net operating loss and credit carryforwards Stock-based compensation Deferred revenue Other\n\nGross deferred tax assets Valuation allowance\n\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance\n\n$\n\n50 $ 139 16 205 16 426 (123 ) 303\n\n57 131 22 156 29 395 (109 ) 286\n\nDeferred tax liabilities:\n\nPrepaids and accruals Acquired intangibles Property and equipment Other\n\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance and deferred tax liabilities\n\n$\n\n31 32 31 10 104 199 $\n\n21 29 25 14 89 197\n\nThe valuation allowance increased by $14 million in fiscal 2019. The increase is mainly attributable to corresponding changes in\n\ndeferred tax assets, primarily foreign tax credit carryforwards and certain state tax credit carryforwards.\n\nAs of April 26, 2019, we have federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $2 million and $3 million,\n\nrespectively. In addition, we have gross state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of $25 million and $138 million, respectively. The majority of the state credit carryforwards are California research credits which are offset by a valuation allowance as we believe it is more likely than not that these credits will not be utilized. We also have $4 million of foreign net operating losses, and $43 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards generated by our Dutch subsidiary which are fully offset by a valuation allowance. Certain acquired net operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382, but are expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance. The federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards and credits will expire in various years from fiscal 2020 through 2038. The California research credit and Dutch foreign tax credit carryforwards do not expire.\n\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):\n\nBalance at beginning of period\n\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year Additions for tax positions of prior years Decreases for tax positions of prior years Settlements\n\nBalance at end of period\n\nYear Ended April 27, 2018\n\n",

See Note 7, “Deferred Compensation,” for further discussion.\n\n16. Restructuring and other exit costs, net\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Board of Directors approved a world-wide restructuring plan (“Fiscal 2018 Plan”) to support the Company's strategic priorities of completing the subscription transition, digitizing the Company, and re-imagining manufacturing, construction, and production. Through the restructuring, Autodesk seeks to reduce its investments in areas not aligned with its strategic priorities, including in areas related to research and development and go-to-market activities. At the same time, Autodesk plans to further invest in strategic priority areas related to digital infrastructure, customer success, and construction. By re-balancing resources to better align with the Company’s strategic priorities, Autodesk is positioning itself to meet its long-term goals. This world-wide restructuring plan included a reduction in force of approximately 11% of the Company’s workforce, or 1,027 employees, and the consolidation of certain leased facilities. By January 31, 2019, the personnel and facilities related actions included in this restructuring plan were substantially complete.\n\nDuring Fiscal 2019, restructuring charges under the Fiscal 2018 Plan included $39.2 million in employee termination\n\nbenefits and $3.2 million in lease termination and other exit costs.\n\n2019 Form 10-K 104\n\n2017\n\n1.7% 2.6%\n\nThe following tables set forth the restructuring charges and other facility exit costs, net during the fiscal years ended\n\nJanuary 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\nBalances, January 31, 2018\n\nAdditions\n\nPayments\n\nAdjustments (1)\n\nBalances, January 31, 2019\n\nFiscal 2018 Plan\n\nEmployee terminations costs\n\n$\n\n53.0\n\n$\n\n39.2\n\n$\n\n(89.7) $\n\n(0.5) $\n\n2.0\n\nFacility terminations and other exit costs\n\n2.5\n\n3.2\n\n(5.7)\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n55.5\n\n$\n\n42.4\n\n$\n\n(95.4) $\n\n(0.4) $\n\n2.1\n\nCurrent portion (2)\n\n$\n\n55.5\n\n$\n\n2.1\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n55.5\n\n$\n\n2.1\n\n____________________ (1) Adjustments primarily relate to the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, settlement of lease contracts, and certain write offs related\n\n(2)\n\nto fixed assets.

Volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was flat in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior-year period. This result reflected merchandising changes and price elasticity-related declines in certain brands, as well as isolated production challenges, partially offset by the continued benefit from momentum and innovation successes in the snacks businesses. Price/ mix was flat compared to the prior year as unfavorable mix, coupled with increases in brand building investments with retailers were offset by the impact of higher pricing. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC, which was completed in October 2017, contributed $41.3 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 results included $115.9 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $156.4 million of net sales related to this divested business.\n\nRefrigerated & Frozen net sales for fiscal 2019 were $2.80 billion, an increase of $51.0 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 1% increase in volume compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales volumes was a result of innovation across multiple brands, which was partially offset by the effects of reduced merchandising spend and the impact of a recall during the fourth quarter. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2018, as continued delivery of top-line accretive innovation in several brands was partially offset by brand building investments with retailers. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business, which was completed in February 2018, contributed $25.7 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition.\n\nInternational net sales for fiscal 2019 were $793.4 million, a decrease of $50.1 million, or 6%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 2% increase in volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, a 4% decrease due to foreign exchange rates, and a 2% increase in price/mix, in each case compared to fiscal 2018. The volume and price/ mix increases for fiscal 2019 were driven by growth in the Canadian snacks and frozen businesses. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $3.7 million to International net sales for fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 included $4.1 million of net sales related to our Del Monte® processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada, which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $48.9 million of net sales related to this divested business. In addition, fiscal 2019 and 2018 results included $17.1 million and $24.5 million, respectively, related to our divested Wesson® oil business.\n\nFoodservice net sales for fiscal 2019 were $934.2 million, a decrease of $120.6 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 14% decrease in volume, excluding divestitures. The decline in volume reflected the continued execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy and the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Price/mix increased 5% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in price/mix for fiscal 2019 reflected favorable product and customer mix, the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing, and the execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy. Fiscal 2019 included $34.2 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $53.4 million of net sales related to this divested business. Net sales declined by approximately 7% in fiscal 2019 due to the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility.\n\nPinnacle Foods net sales for fiscal 2019 (reflecting 213 days of Conagra Brands ownership) were $1.73 billion.

No shares were considered antidilutive for the year ended September 30, 2017.\n\nUse of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, related revenues and expenses and disclosure about contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Significant estimates include the rebates related to revenue recognition, stock based compensation and the valuation of inventory, long-lived assets, finite lived intangible assets and goodwill. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements: In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. There have been further amendments, including practical expedients, with the issuance of ASU 2018-01 in January 2018, ASU 2018-11 in July 2018 and ASU 2018-20 in December 2018. The amended guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those reporting periods, with early adoption permitted. The guidance will be applied on a modified retrospective basis with the earliest period presented. Based on the effective date, this guidance will apply beginning October 1, 2019. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have no impact to retained earnings or net income. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02 on October 1, 2019, we anticipate recording a right-of-use asset and an offsetting lease liability of approximately $2.3 to $2.9 million.\n\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 Intangibles-Goodwill, which offers amended guidance to simplify the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. A goodwill impairment will now be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This guidance is to be applied on a prospective basis effective for the Company’s interim and annual periods beginning after January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted for any impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. The Company does not believe the adoption of this ASU will have a material impact on our financial statements.\n\n36\n\n2017 3,847,839 13,532,375 128,431 13,660,806\n\n0.28 0."

We also present Free Cash Flow, which is a non-U.S. GAAP measure, defined as (i) net cash from operating activities plus (ii) net cash used in investing activities, excluding payment for purchases (and proceeds from the sale) of marketable securities, and net cash variation for joint ventures deconsolidation, which are considered as temporary financial investments. The result of this definition is ultimately net cash from operating activities plus payment for purchase and proceeds from sale of tangible, intangible and financial assets, proceeds received in the sale of businesses and cash paid for business acquisitions. We believe Free Cash Flow, a non-U.S. GAAP measure, provides useful information for investors and management because it measures our capacity to generate cash from our operating and investing activities to sustain our operations. Free Cash Flow is not a U.S. GAAP measure and does not represent total cash flow since it does not include the cash flows generated by or used in financing activities. Free Cash Flow reconciles with the total cash flow and the net cash increase (decrease) by including the payment for purchases (and proceeds from the sale) of marketable securities and net cash variation from joint ventures deconsolidation, the net cash from (used in) financing activities and the effect of changes in exchange rates.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTThe Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is determined based upon the exit price that would be received to sellan asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, as determined by either the principal market or the most advantageousmarket. Inputs used in the valuation techniques to derive fair values are classified based on a three-level hierarchy, as follows:Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2—Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets with insufficient volumeor infrequent transactions (less active markets), or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from orcorroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3—Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities.The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company’sinvestments are in money market funds, U.S. treasury bonds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, asset-backed securities and corporate debt securities, whichare classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, and were initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued at each reporting date utilizingmarket-observable data. The market-observable data included reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, bids, offers, current spotrates and other industry and economic events.The fair value of these assets measured on a recurring basis was determined using the following inputs as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands): December 31, 2019 QuotedPrices inActiveMarkets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) Total FairValueAssets: Money market funds$— $2,010 $— $2,010U.S. treasury bonds— 116,835 — 116,835Commercial paper— 44,300 — 44,300Certificates of deposit— 24,539 — 24,539Asset-backed securities— 73,499 — 73,499Corporate debt securities— 181,079 — 181,079Total$— $442,262 $— $442,26282",

IMFT is governed by a Board of Managers, for which the number of managers appointed by each member varies based on the members' respective ownership interests. IMFT manufactures semiconductor products exclusively for its members under a long-term supply agreement at prices approximating cost. In 2018, IMFT discontinued production of NAND and subsequent to that time manufactured 3D XPoint memory. In 2018, we announced that we and Intel will no longer jointly develop 3D XPoint technology beyond the second generation and we substantially completed this cost-sharing arrangement in the first quarter of 2020. IMFT sales to Intel were $731 million, $507 million, and $493 million for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\n\nIMFT's capital requirements are generally determined based on an annual plan approved by the members, and capital contributions to IMFT are requested as needed. Capital requests are made to the members in proportion to their then-current ownership interest. Members may elect to not contribute their proportional share, and in such event, the contributing member may elect to contribute any amount of the capital request, either in the form of an equity contribution or member debt financing. Under the supply agreement, the members have rights and obligations to the capacity of IMFT in proportion to their investment, including member debt financing. Any capital contribution or member debt financing results in a proportionate adjustment to the sharing of output on an eight-month lag. Pursuant to the terms of the IMFT joint venture agreement, Intel provided debt financing of $1.01 billion to IMFT in 2018 and IMFT repaid $316 million to Intel in 2019. As of August 29, 2019, current debt included $693 million of IMFT Member Debt. Members pay their proportionate share of fixed costs associated with IMFT's capacity.\n\nIn January 2019, we exercised our option to acquire Intel's interest in IMFT. Subsequently, Intel set the closing date to occur on October 31, 2019, at which time IMFT will become a wholly-owned subsidiary. In the first quarter of 2020, we expect to pay Intel approximately $1.4 billion in cash for Intel's noncontrolling interest in IMFT and IMFT member debt. Pursuant to the terms of the IMFT wafer supply agreement, Intel notified us of its election to receive supply from IMFT from the closing date through April 2020 at a volume equal to approximately 50% of their volume from IMFT in the six-month period prior to closing.\n\n68\n\nCreditors of IMFT have recourse only to IMFT's assets and do not have recourse to any other of our assets.

            "Table of Contents\n\nCustomer-related intangible assets consist of Microsemi's contractual relationships and customer loyalty related to its distributor and end-customer relationships. The fair values of the customer-related intangibles were determined using the distributor method, a form of the income approach based on distributor margin and expected attrition and revenue growth for Microsemi's existing customers as of the acquisition date. Customer relationships are being amortized in a manner based on the estimated cash flows associated with the existing customers and anticipated retention rates.\n\nBacklog relates to the value of orders not yet shipped by Microsemi at the acquisition date, and the fair values are being determined based on the estimated profit associated with those orders. Backlog related assets have a one year useful life and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over that period.\n\nThe total weighted average amortization period of intangible assets acquired as a result of the Microsemi transaction is 13\n\nyears. Amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets is not deductible for tax purposes. Thus, approximately $856.7 million was established as a net deferred tax liability for the future amortization of the intangible assets.\n\nThe amount of Microsemi net sales and net loss included in the Company's consolidated statements of income for the fiscal\n\nyear ended March 31, 2019 was approximately $1,568.6 million and $570.8 million, respectively.\n\nThe following unaudited pro-forma consolidated results of operations for the fiscal year ended March 31,\n\n2019 and 2018 assume the closing of the Microsemi acquisition occurred as of April 1, 2017. The pro-forma adjustments are mainly comprised of acquired inventory fair value costs and amortization of purchased intangible assets.

The Company\n\npaid an aggregate of approximately $2.98 billion in cash and issued an aggregate of 10.1 million shares of its common stock to Atmel stockholders valued at $486.1 million based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on April 4, 2016 and incurred transaction and other fees of approximately $14.9 million. The total consideration transferred in the acquisition, including approximately $7.5 million of non-cash consideration for the exchange of certain share-based payment awards of Atmel for stock awards of the Company, was approximately $3.47 billion. In addition to the consideration transferred, the Company recognized in its consolidated financial statements $653.0 million in liabilities of Atmel consisting of debt, taxes payable and deferred, pension obligations, restructuring, and contingent and other liabilities. The Company financed the cash portion of the purchase price using approximately $2.04 billion of cash held by certain of its foreign subsidiaries and approximately $0.94 billion from additional borrowings under its existing credit agreement. As a result of the acquisition, Atmel became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Atmel is a worldwide leader in the design and manufacture of microcontrollers, capacitive touch solutions, advanced logic, mixed-signal, nonvolatile memory and radio frequency components. The Company's primary reason for this acquisition was to expand the Company's range of solutions, products and capabilities by extending its served available market.\n\nThe acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting, with the Company identified as the acquirer, and the operating results of Atmel have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements as of the closing date of the acquisition. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the aggregate amount of consideration paid by the Company was allocated to Atmel's net tangible assets and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of April 4, 2016. The excess of the purchase price over the value of the net tangible assets and intangible assets was recorded to goodwill. The factors contributing to the recognition of goodwill were based upon the Company's conclusion that there are strategic and synergistic benefits that are expected to be realized from the acquisition. The goodwill has been allocated to the Company's\n\n"

            "Revenue from Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. was 12% of total revenue for 2019. Revenue from Kingston Technology\n\nCompany, Inc. was 11% of total revenue for 2019 and 10% of total revenue for 2018 and 2017. No other customer exceeded 10% of our total revenue. Our sales to Huawei were included in our MBU, CNBU, SBU, and EBU segments and our sales to Kingston were included in our CNBU, MBU, and SBU segments.\n\nWe generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and production equipment; however, only a limited\n\nnumber of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and production equipment that meet our standards and, in some cases, materials or production equipment are provided by a single supplier.\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, money market\n\naccounts, certificates of deposit, fixed-rate debt securities, trade receivables, share repurchase, capped call, and derivative contracts. We invest through high-credit-quality financial institutions and, by policy, generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting investments with any single obligor and monitoring credit risk of bank counterparties on an ongoing basis. A concentration of credit risk may exist with respect to receivables of certain customers. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of customers worldwide and generally do not require collateral from our customers. Historically, we have not experienced material losses on receivables. A concentration of risk may also exist with respect to our foreign currency hedges as the number of counterparties to our hedges is limited and the notional amounts are relatively large. We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions and through entering into master netting arrangements. Capped call agreements expose us to credit risk to the extent the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions and by spreading the risk across several major financial institutions. In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.\n\nGeographic Information\n\nRevenue based on the geographic location of our customer's headquarters was as follows:\n\nFor the year ended United States Mainland China (excluding Hong Kong) Taiwan Hong Kong Other Asia Pacific Japan Other\n\n$\n\n2019\n\n12,451 3,595 2,703 1,614 1,032 958 1,053 23,406\n\n$\n\n2018\n\n17,116 3,607 3,918 1,761 1,458 1,265 1,266 30,391\n\n$\n\n$\n\n$\n\n$\n\nWe ship our products to locations specified by our customers and, as a result, customers may have headquarters in one location with global supply chain and operations in other locations.

Product revenue increased by 6% and service revenue increased by 2%. Our total revenue reflected growth across each of our geographic segments. Product revenue for the BRICM countries, in the aggregate, experienced 1% product revenue decline, driven by a 16% decrease in product revenue in China and a decrease of 1% in Brazil. These decreases were partially offset by increased product revenue in Mexico, Russia and India of 26%, 6% and 5%, respectively.\n\nIn addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a reduced IT spending environment and reductions in spending by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple performance obligations; the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors. In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment.\n\n",

The Company implemented changes to its accounting policies, internal controls and disclosures to support the new standard; however, these changes were not material.\n\n2. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK\n\nThe Company’s principal financial instrument subject to potential concentration of credit risk is accounts receivable, which is unsecured. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to estimated losses expected to be incurred in the collection of accounts receivable. The Company has adopted credit policies and standards intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk and it believes that credit risks are moderated by the financial stability of its major customers, conservative payment terms and the Company’s strict credit policies.\n\nRevenue representing 10% or more of respective periods, are summarized as follows:\n\nfrom significant\n\ncustomers,\n\nrevenue for\n\nthose the\n\n2019\n\nFiscal Year 2018\n\n2017\n\nApple Inc.

Leaseexpense for minimum lease payments was recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. See Note 9 for further disclosures regarding the Company’soperating leases.Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”). ASU 2019-12 is intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes by, among other things, eliminating certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod taxallocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences.ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, the Company must apply certainaspects of this standard retrospectively for all periods presented while other aspects are applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effectadjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on itsconsolidated financial statements.In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments(“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 is intended to provide more decision-useful information about expected credit losses on financial instruments and othercommitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The main provisions include presenting financial assets measured at amortized costat the amount expected to be collected, which is net of an allowance for expected credit losses, and recording credit losses related to available-for-sale securitiesthrough an allowance for credit losses. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and must be appliedusing a modified retrospective approach with earlier adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company does not expect theadoption of this amendment to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.4. REVENUEThe Company adopted ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. The Company recognized the cumulative effect ofinitially applying ASC 606, which was immaterial, as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative prior period information isaccounted for in accordance with the previous revenue guidance, ASC 605, and has not been restated. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company recognizesrevenue under the core principle to depict the transfer of control to the Company’s customers in an amount reflecting the consideration the Company expects to beentitled. In order to achieve that core principle, the Company applies the following five step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify theperformance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5)recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.Revenue for product sales is recognized at the point in time when control transfers to the Company’s customers, which is generally when products areshipped from the Company’s manufacturing facilities or when delivered to the customer’s named location. When the Company performs shipping and handlingactivities after the transfer of control to the customer (e.g., when control transfers prior to delivery), they are considered to be fulfillment activities, andaccordingly, the costs are accrued for when the related revenue is recognized. Taxes collected on behalf of customers relating to product sales and remitted togovernmental authorities, principally sales taxes, are excluded from revenue.",

We also present Free Cash Flow, which is a non-U.S. GAAP measure, defined as (i) net cash from operating activities plus (ii) net cash used in investing activities, excluding payment for purchases (and proceeds from the sale) of marketable securities, and net cash variation for joint ventures deconsolidation, which are considered as temporary financial investments. The result of this definition is ultimately net cash from operating activities plus payment for purchase and proceeds from sale of tangible, intangible and financial assets, proceeds received in the sale of businesses and cash paid for business acquisitions. We believe Free Cash Flow, a non-U.S. GAAP measure, provides useful information for investors and management because it measures our capacity to generate cash from our operating and investing activities to sustain our operations. Free Cash Flow is not a U.S. GAAP measure and does not represent total cash flow since it does not include the cash flows generated by or used in financing activities. Free Cash Flow reconciles with the total cash flow and the net cash increase (decrease) by including the payment for purchases (and proceeds from the sale) of marketable securities and net cash variation from joint ventures deconsolidation, the net cash from (used in) financing activities and the effect of changes in exchange rates.

Product revenue increased by 6% and service revenue increased by 2%. Our total revenue reflected growth across each of our geographic segments. Product revenue for the BRICM countries, in the aggregate, experienced 1% product revenue decline, driven by a 16% decrease in product revenue in China and a decrease of 1% in Brazil. These decreases were partially offset by increased product revenue in Mexico, Russia and India of 26%, 6% and 5%, respectively.\n\nIn addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a reduced IT spending environment and reductions in spending by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple performance obligations; the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors. In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment.\n\n",
            "Cash flow from continuing operating activities increased primarily due to a one-time tax payment of $887 million related to the gain on sale from the divestiture of our Veritas information management business in fiscal 2017 and an increase in deferred revenue.\n\nDeferred revenue increased $316 million primarily due to our shift in sales contracts to a higher mix of solutions subject to ratable versus point in time revenue recognition and longer contract duration in our Enterprise Security segment, which resulted in less in-period revenue recognized, and due to higher billings towards the end of the fiscal year, reflecting seasonal sales cycles in that segment. These factors were partially offset by a decrease of $319 million in deferred revenue as a result of the divestiture of our WSS and PKI solutions.\n\nSegment operating results\n\nEnterprise Security segment\n\nFiscal Year\n\nVariance in\n\n(In millions, except for percentages) Net revenues Percentage of total net revenues Operating income Operating margin\n\n2018\n\n$2,554\n\n53%\n\n$ 473\n\n19%\n\n2017\n\n$2,355\n\n59%\n\n$ 187\n\n8%\n\nDollars\n\n$ 199\n\n$ 286\n\nPercent\n\n8%\n\n153%\n\nRevenue increased $199 million primarily due to increases of $331 million in revenue from sales\n\nof our network and web security solutions and $36 million from sales of endpoint and information protection solutions, partially offset by a $184 million decrease in revenue as a result of the divestiture of our WSS and PKI solutions. Revenue during fiscal 2018 was also unfavorably affected by a shift in the mix of sales towards subscription and cloud-delivered solutions subject to ratable revenue recognition, which resulted in less in-period recognized revenue and more revenue deferred to the balance sheet as compared to fiscal 2017. Operating income increased $286 million primarily due to higher revenue discussed above, a $51 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses and a $38 million decrease in cost of revenues.\n\nConsumer Cyber Safety segment\n\nFiscal Year\n\nVariance in\n\n(In millions, except for percentages) Net revenues Percentage of total net revenues Operating income Operating margin\n\n2018\n\n$2,280\n\n47%\n\n$1,111\n\n49%\n\n2017\n\n$1,664\n\n41%\n\n$ 839\n\n50%\n\nDollars\n\n$ 616\n\n$ 272\n\nPercent\n\n37%\n\n32%\n\nRevenue increased $616 million due to a $639 million increase in revenue from sales of our identity and information protection products acquired at the end of fiscal 2017, offset by a $23 million decrease in revenue related to our consumer security products. Our revenue growth reflects the benefit of the shift to subscription-based contracts and bundling of our consumer products, which is helping to mitigate the trend of declining revenues from sales of stand-alone security products. Operating income increased $272 million primarily due to sales of our identity and information protection products, partially offset by higher related cost of sales and operating expenses.\n\n47"

            "performed in early 2019, the results of which were reported to the Audit Committee in March 2019. The key finding from the review was the need to increase the use of data analytics within the function.\n\nExternal auditor Transition of external auditor Deloitte was appointed as intu’s external auditor for the 2019 audit following approval at the 2019 AGM, succeeding PwC. Although it is still early into Deloitte’s tenure as intu’s external auditor, I am pleased that the transition of the external audit process has gone well. The Audit Committee has recommended that Deloitte be reappointed as external auditor at the 2020 AGM.\n\nA key area of focus for the Audit Committee in 2019 was the effective transition of the external audit process from PwC to Deloitte. For this to be achieved, a detailed transition plan was put in place between management and Deloitte with the aim of familiarising Deloitte with intu. In addition to regular communication between the Group finance team and Deloitte, the key areas of the transition plan included:\n\n— site visits to shopping centres to see how the assets are operated as well as meeting with centre management and leasing teams\n\n— meetings with the Group’s third- party valuers to understand the valuation process\n\n— detailed reviews of the Group’s\n\ncash flow, financing and covenant projections\n\nExternal auditor effectiveness The Audit Committee has assessed the effectiveness of the external auditor, Deloitte, in line with the approach set out in the FRC’s Audit Quality Practice Aid tailored to the fact that it is Deloitte’s first year as intu’s external auditor. In carrying out the evaluation for 2019 the Audit Committee has reviewed and challenged with the external auditor:\n\n— the 2019 audit plan presented by\n\nDeloitte, including the risks identified and its audit approach\n\n— the FRC’s audit quality inspection\n\nreview of Deloitte\n\n— the output of the audit, including reports to the Audit Committee and management\n\n— performance of the audit team\n\nNon-audit services On 1 January 2017 the Group implemented the FRC’s Ethical Standard for Auditors which imposes restrictions on certain non-audit services. The FRC’s Revised Ethical Standard will become effective for the Group from 15 March 2020. The majority of non-audit related services are prohibited and others require approval by the Audit Committee. There is a statutory overall fee limit of 70 per cent of the average of audit fees charged in the past three years.\n\nThe Audit Committee has sole authority to approve contracts for non-audit services with the external auditor, subject to observing certain guidelines. In order to ensure that external auditor independence and objectivity is maintained, the Audit Committee considers whether the proposed arrangements will maintain external auditor independence. The external auditor must also satisfy the Company that it is acting independently.\n\nThe table below summarises the fees paid to the external auditor over the last three years (with 2019 being attributable to Deloitte, and 2018 and 2017 attributable to PwC).\n\n— Deloitte shadowing PwC through the 2018 audit and attending the November 2018 and February 2019 Audit Committee meetings\n\n— regular communication between\n\nmanagement, Deloitte and PwC to agree and facilitate the handover process\n\n— Deloitte’s review of PwC’s 2018\n\naudit files\n\n— meetings with senior management across intu to familiarise Deloitte with key business processes\n\nat meetings\n\nThe above was assessed through internal feedback, direct meetings, reviews of internal as well as independent reports.\n\nFollowing this review, the Audit Committee has concluded that Deloitte has been effective in its role as external auditor for the 2019 audit. The Audit Committee will continue to review the effectiveness and independence of the external auditor each year.\n\nAudit Committee effectiveness As part of the Board evaluation process, the effectiveness of the Audit Committee was reviewed and this confirmed that the Committee remained effective at meeting its objectives.\n\nSteve Barber Chairman of the Audit Committee 12 March 2020\n\n2019 £000\n\n2018 £000\n\n2017 £000\n\nAudit fees Non-audit fees Total fees paid to auditor Ratio of non-audit fees to audit fees\n\n1,092 598 1,690 55%\n\n823 281 1,104 34%\n\n789 49 838 6%\n\nintu properties plc Annual report 2019\n\n",

The Group holds 50 per cent beneficial interests in the relevant freehold or leasehold of these properties. Each joint arrangement is governed by a Trust Deed giving each party rights to income and obligations for expenses in respect of their beneficial interest in the property. The management of the property is established under the Trust Deed as being undertaken by an entity jointly controlled by the beneficial owners of the property. This entity does not have the right to a share of the income or expenditure from the property, other than the receipt of a management fee. Therefore these interests are accounted for as joint operations.

Both companies are incorporated in India.\n\nThe equity method of accounting is applied to the Group’s investments in Prozone and Empire in line with the requirements of IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. The results for the year to 30 September have been used as 31 December information is not available in time for these financial statements. Those results are adjusted to be in line with the Group’s accounting policies and include the most recent property valuations, determined at 30 September 2019, by independent professionally qualified external valuers in line with the valuation methodology described in note 13.\n\nThe market price per share of Prozone at 31 December 2019 was INR19 (31 December 2018: INR29), valuing the Group’s interest at £9.9 million (31 December 2018: £16.4 million) compared with the Prozone carrying value pre-impairment of £41.5 million (31 December 2018: £45.1 million). As the share price of Prozone is lower than its carrying value, a review of the carrying value of Prozone and the Group’s direct interest in Empire (as it also forms part of the Prozone group) has been undertaken. Underpinning the impairment assessment (where the fair value less costs to sell was considered) were the independent third-party valuations received for the investment and development properties, representing the underlying value of the associate’s net assets. Assumptions were also made for tax and other costs that would be reasonably expected if these assets were to be disposed of.

Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, consisting of net loss of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $26.2 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $16.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $10.0 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an outflow from the changes in accrued liabilities and other of $5.9 million and inventory of $5.6 million, partially offset by an inflow from changes in deferred revenue of $3.2 million.\n\nThe unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and other was driven by an increase in lease liabilities associated with the lease of the San Jose corporate office. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to build up of inventory and timing of shipments, partially offset by increased reserves. The favorable change in deferred revenues was primarily driven by increased bookings.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million, consisting of net loss of $27.6 million which includes payments for our internal investigation costs of $8.6 million, non-cash charges of $25.0 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.9 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $3.1 million, offset primarily by an outflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $6.1 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and inventory of $1.5 million.\n\nThe favorable change in deferred revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the sale of subscription and support. The favorable change in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, increased value added tax accrual due to timing of payments, and an increase in legal fees accrual. The unfavorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections. The unfavorable change in prepaid and other assets was mainly driven by the increase in deferred sales commissions due to higher deferred revenue and higher average commission rate. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to the timing of shipments.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $14.3 million, consisting of a net loss of $10.8 million, a cash decrease resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million and non-cash charges of $26.4 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $17.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance of $1.1 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $12.4 million and deferred revenue of $3.0 million, and an outflow from the change in accrued liabilities of $8.9 million, inventory of $4.7 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and accounts payable of $0.9 million.\n\n",

Respectively, in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, the $0.8 million, $1.3 million, and $0.8 million cash flows used in financing activities were primarily comprised of the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding and to cover the exercise price of the options, and payments on capital lease obligations.\n\nInvestments\n\nInvestments in Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies\n\nAgilysys invests in corporate-owned life insurance policies for certain former executives, for which some are endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements.

The increase was attributable to an increase in total revenues (revenues and net pool allocation) of $103.7 million, partially offset by a decrease of $23.5 million caused by movements in working capital accounts, an increase of $15.3 million in cash paid for interest including the interest paid for finance leases and a net decrease of $4.8 million from the remaining movements.\n\nNet Cash Used In Investing Activities\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $618.4 million, from $74.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $693.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is mainly attributable to an increase of $591.5 million in payments for the construction costs of newbuildings and other fixed assets and a net decrease in cash from short-term investments of $43.0 million in 2018 compared to 2017. The above movements were partially offset by $14.0 million in payments made for the investment in Gastrade made in 2017 and an increase of $2.1 million in cash from interest income.\n\n"

No shares were considered antidilutive for the year ended September 30, 2017.\n\nUse of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, related revenues and expenses and disclosure about contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Significant estimates include the rebates related to revenue recognition, stock based compensation and the valuation of inventory, long-lived assets, finite lived intangible assets and goodwill. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements: In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. There have been further amendments, including practical expedients, with the issuance of ASU 2018-01 in January 2018, ASU 2018-11 in July 2018 and ASU 2018-20 in December 2018. The amended guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those reporting periods, with early adoption permitted. The guidance will be applied on a modified retrospective basis with the earliest period presented. Based on the effective date, this guidance will apply beginning October 1, 2019. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have no impact to retained earnings or net income. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02 on October 1, 2019, we anticipate recording a right-of-use asset and an offsetting lease liability of approximately $2.3 to $2.9 million.\n\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 Intangibles-Goodwill, which offers amended guidance to simplify the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. A goodwill impairment will now be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This guidance is to be applied on a prospective basis effective for the Company’s interim and annual periods beginning after January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted for any impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. The Company does not believe the adoption of this ASU will have a material impact on our financial statements.\n\n36\n\n2017 3,847,839 13,532,375 128,431 13,660,806\n\n0.28 0.",

In addition, ESPP provides for annual increases in the number of shares available for issuance on the first day of each year equal to the least of (i) 0.5% of the outstanding shares of common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding year, (ii) 400,000 shares or (iii) such other amount as may be determined by the Board of Directors.

Share-based compensation expense is recognized regardless of the number of awards that are earned based on the market condition and isrecognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated service period of approximately three years. If the required service period is not met for these options, thenthe share-based compensation expense would be reversed. In the event that our common stock achieves the target price per share based on a 30-day trailingaverage prior to the end of the estimated service period, any remaining unamortized compensation cost will be recognized.Stock options with market-based vesting criteria granted for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 were 585,000, 325,000 and 320,000, respectively, atweighted average grant date fair values of $7.47, $15.52 and $13.18 per share, or total grant date fair value $2.4 million, $5.0 million and $4.3 million,respectively."

            "gas, chemicals, mining, data centers, airports, and rail compa- nies. Competitors in the transmission business consist mainly of a small number of large multinational companies, increasingly joined by smaller, fast-growing manufacturers in emerging coun- tries including China, India and Korea.\n\nSeveral trends are affecting the businesses of the Operating Com- pany. In the power generation business, the ongoing strong growth in demand for power from renewable sources – which come with associated short-term fluctuations in power genera- tion levels – is shifting market demand from fossil baseload gen- eration to more flexible, highly efficient and affordable gas power plants with low emissions, in particular in Europe, Latin America and Asia. A second trend is that the development and execution of large projects increasingly requires financing by the OEM, in- cluding equity participation. For Gas and Power, this role is ful- filled by Financial Services, which can offer customers a range of financing and equity options backed by domain know-how. In general, the markets for the Operating Company are strongly af- fected by changes in national energy regulations, such as support of renewable energy, the security of supply through capacity mar- kets or strategic reserve capacity, carbon pricing and climate change targets, and modernization of energy and electricity mar- kets. Fuel efficiency standards in the U. S. and the European Union are expected to weigh on future demand for fossil transportation fuels in these regions, contrasting with strong growth in transpor- tation-related fuel use in other world regions, particularly in Asia.\n\nIn Oil and Gas, the role of natural gas compared to other fossil fuels is growing from the mid- to long-term perspective, facili- tated by its lower carbon footprint. Furthermore, declining pro- duction from maturing oil and gas fields, or depletion, requires improved recovery technologies as well as additional mechanical and electrical power, necessitating continuous investments. At the same time, oil and gas companies increasingly focus on asset economics and emission footprint, requiring products and solu- tions offering an improved balance of high asset productivity with safety and environmental performance. Generally, our oil and gas business benefits from these major market trends. At the same time, our diversified and global presence across the oil and gas value chain and other industries – each following their own business cycles – offers stable opportunities for our business.\n\nThe transmission business generally benefits from major trends and changes in global electrical power systems, in particular decarbonization, digitalization and global electrification. Decar- bonization is shifting the focus of generation to both central and decentral renewables. This shift increases demand for offshore connectivity and grid stability, requiring environmentally friendly products and systems. The integration of wind power, photo- voltaics, biomass, storage and other intermittent or distributed energy resources into efficient and reliable power networks\n\nincreases grid complexity. Holistic asset transparency to increase efficiency of existing grid assets and performance, enabled by digitalization, is becoming increasingly important. Digitalization involves increased product and system connectivity and provid- ing intelligent solutions for the management of complex energy networks. Connected assets provide value potential for additional services and enhanced asset operation. The continuously grow- ing demand for electricity worldwide requires stable transporta- tion of greener bulk power with minimal losses from the location of generation to different demand load centers, some of which may even be located in other countries.\n\nR & D activities of the power generation and oil and gas busi- nesses concentrate on developing products and solutions for enhancing efficiency and flexibility, and for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in power generation and in the oil and gas indus- try. These products and solutions include turbomachinery – primarily high-performance, low-emission gas turbines for sim- ple-cycle operation or for combined-cycle power plants – and compressor solutions combining electrical, automation, and digitalization offerings for oil and gas as well as process indus- tries. A field of activity is using hydrogen as a renewable fuel in gas turbines. Gas and Power is also intensifying R & D in innova- tive materials, advanced manufacturing methods and plant opti- mization. In the transmission business, R & D activities focus on preparing the portfolio for a deregulated environment in which total cost of ownership is decisive. Innovations accordingly focus on product digitalization, power electronics, software-driven power control, environmentally friendly products and systems, and grid stabilization. The increasing infeed of renewable energy to power grids, with distributed generation on the rise, requires those grids to become more flexible and efficient. The invest- ments of Gas and Power are focused on enhancing productivity through automation and increasing customer proximity via stra- tegic localization of capacity. Investing activities mainly relate to gas turbines and turbine components.\n\nFiscal year\n\n% Change\n\n(in millions of €)\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nActual\n\nComp.\n\nOrders\n\n19,975\n\n18,451\n\n8 %\n\n7 %\n\nRevenue\n\n17,663\n\n18,125\n\n(3) %\n\n(4) %\n\ntherein: service business\n\n8,025\n\n7,756\n\n3 %\n\n2 %\n\nAdjusted EBITA\n\n679\n\n722\n\n(6) %\n\nAdjusted EBITA margin\n\n3.8 %\n\n4.0 %\n\nOrders were up clearly year-over-year, due mainly to higher orders in the new-unit business.

Volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was flat in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior-year period. This result reflected merchandising changes and price elasticity-related declines in certain brands, as well as isolated production challenges, partially offset by the continued benefit from momentum and innovation successes in the snacks businesses. Price/ mix was flat compared to the prior year as unfavorable mix, coupled with increases in brand building investments with retailers were offset by the impact of higher pricing. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC, which was completed in October 2017, contributed $41.3 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 results included $115.9 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $156.4 million of net sales related to this divested business.\n\nRefrigerated & Frozen net sales for fiscal 2019 were $2.80 billion, an increase of $51.0 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 1% increase in volume compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales volumes was a result of innovation across multiple brands, which was partially offset by the effects of reduced merchandising spend and the impact of a recall during the fourth quarter. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2018, as continued delivery of top-line accretive innovation in several brands was partially offset by brand building investments with retailers. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business, which was completed in February 2018, contributed $25.7 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition.\n\nInternational net sales for fiscal 2019 were $793.4 million, a decrease of $50.1 million, or 6%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 2% increase in volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, a 4% decrease due to foreign exchange rates, and a 2% increase in price/mix, in each case compared to fiscal 2018. The volume and price/ mix increases for fiscal 2019 were driven by growth in the Canadian snacks and frozen businesses. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $3.7 million to International net sales for fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 included $4.1 million of net sales related to our Del Monte® processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada, which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $48.9 million of net sales related to this divested business. In addition, fiscal 2019 and 2018 results included $17.1 million and $24.5 million, respectively, related to our divested Wesson® oil business.\n\nFoodservice net sales for fiscal 2019 were $934.2 million, a decrease of $120.6 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 14% decrease in volume, excluding divestitures. The decline in volume reflected the continued execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy and the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Price/mix increased 5% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in price/mix for fiscal 2019 reflected favorable product and customer mix, the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing, and the execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy. Fiscal 2019 included $34.2 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $53.4 million of net sales related to this divested business. Net sales declined by approximately 7% in fiscal 2019 due to the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility.\n\nPinnacle Foods net sales for fiscal 2019 (reflecting 213 days of Conagra Brands ownership) were $1.73 billion.

We believe that our foreign subsidiaries have invested or will invest any undistributed earnings indefinitely, or that any undistributed earnings will be remitted in a tax-neutral transaction, and, therefore, do not provide deferred taxes on the cumulative undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.\n\nOur preliminary estimate of capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 is approximately $400 million.\n\nManagement believes that existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, existing credit facilities, and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our repayment of debt, including any repayment of debt or refinancing of debt, working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months.\n\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\n\nWe use off-balance sheet arrangements (e.g., leases accounted for as operating leases) where sound business principles warrant their use. We also periodically enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. These are described further in \"Obligations and Commitments\" below.\n\nVariable Interest Entities Not Consolidated\n\nWe lease or leased certain office buildings from entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities. The lease agreements with these entities include fixed-price purchase options for the assets being leased. The lease agreements also contain contingent put options (the \"lease put options\") that allow or allowed the lessors to require us to purchase the buildings at the greater of original construction cost, or fair market value, without a lease agreement in place (the \"put price\") in certain limited circumstances. As a result of substantial impairment charges related to our divested Private Brands operations, these lease put options became exercisable. We are amortizing the difference between the put price and the estimated fair value (without a lease agreement in place) of the property over the remaining lease term within SG&A expenses. During fiscal 2018, we purchased two buildings that were subject to lease put options and recognized net losses totaling $48.2 million for the early exit of unfavorable lease contracts. During fiscal 2017, one of these lease agreements expired, and we reversed the applicable accrual and recognized a benefit of $6.7 million in SG&A expenses.\n\nAs of May 26, 2019 and May 27, 2018, there was one remaining leased building subject to a lease put option for which the put option price exceeded the estimated fair value of the property by $8.2 million, of which we had accrued $1.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively. This lease is accounted for as an operating lease, and accordingly, there are no material assets and liabilities, other than the accrued portion of the put price, associated with this entity included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of this entity. In making this determination, we have considered, among other items, the terms of the lease agreement, the expected remaining useful life of the asset leased, and the capital structure of the lessor entity.\n\nOBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS\n\nAs part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements, debt agreements, and unconditional purchase obligations (i.e., obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices, such as \"take-or-pay\" contracts). The unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in our normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available. Of these items, debt, notes payable, and capital lease obligations, which totaled $10.72 billion as of May 26, 2019, were recognized as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations, which totaled $1.75 billion as of May 26, 2019, were not recognized as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\n37\n\nA summary of our contractual obligations as of May 26, 2019, was as follows:\n\nPayments Due by Period (in millions)\n\nContractual Obligations Long-term debt . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Capital lease obligations . . . . . . . . . .\n\nTotal\n\n10,556.6\n\n165.4\n\n$\n\nLess than 1 Year\n\n— $\n\n20.6\n\n1-3 Years\n\n2,747.6\n\n41.0\n\n$\n\n3-5 Years\n\n2,287.0\n\n29.4\n\n$\n\nAfter 5 Years\n\n5,522.0\n\n74.4\n\nOperating lease obligations . . . . . . . .

Such agreements are generally settleable in the ordinary course of business in less than one year.\n\nWe are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our long-term debt and capital lease obligations. The weighted-\n\naverage coupon interest rate of the long-term debt obligations outstanding as of May 26, 2019, was approximately 4.7%.\n\nAs of May 26, 2019, we had aggregate unfunded pension and postretirement benefit obligations totaling $131.7 million and $87.8 million, respectively. These amounts are not included in the table above as the unfunded obligations are remeasured each fiscal year, thereby resulting in our inability to accurately predict the ultimate amount and timing of any future required contributions to such plans. Based on current statutory requirements, we are not obligated to fund any amount to our qualified pension plans during the next twelve months. We estimate that we will make payments of approximately $14.2 million and $10.8 million over the next twelve months to fund our pension and postretirement plans, respectively.",
            " See Note 19 \"Pension and Postretirement Benefits\" to the consolidated financial statements and \"Critical Accounting Estimates - Employment Related Benefits\" contained in this report for further discussion of our pension obligations and factors that could affect estimates of this liability.\n\nAs part of our ongoing operations, we also enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments only upon the occurrence of a future event (e.g., guarantees of debt or lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable to perform). In accordance with U.S. GAAP, such commercial commitments are not recognized as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of May 26, 2019, we had other commercial commitments totaling $5.3 million, of which $3.7 million expire in less than one year and $1.6 million expire in one to three years.\n\nIn addition to the other commercial commitments, as of May 26, 2019, we had $56.4 million of standby letters of credit issued on our behalf. These standby letters of credit are primarily related to our self-insured workers compensation programs and are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nIn certain limited situations, we will guarantee an obligation of an unconsolidated entity. We guarantee certain leases resulting from the divestiture of the JM Swank business completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. As of May 26, 2019, the remaining terms of these arrangements did not exceed four years and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was $1.2 million. In addition, we guarantee a lease resulting from an exited facility. As of May 26, 2019, the remaining term of this arrangement did not exceed eight years and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was $19.1 million.\n\nWe also guarantee an obligation of the Lamb Weston business pursuant to a guarantee arrangement that existed prior to the Spinoff and remained in place following completion of the Spinoff until such guarantee obligation is substituted for guarantees issued by Lamb Weston. Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, dated as of November 8, 2016 (the \"Separation Agreement\"), between us and Lamb Weston, this guarantee arrangement is deemed a liability of Lamb Weston that was transferred to Lamb Weston as part of the Spinoff. Accordingly, in the event that we are required to make any payments as a result of this guarantee arrangement, Lamb Weston is obligated to indemnify us for any such liability, reduced by any insurance proceeds received by us, in accordance with the terms of the indemnification provisions under the Separation Agreement.\n\nLamb Weston is a party to an agricultural sublease agreement with a third party for certain farmland through 2020 (subject, at Lamb Weston's option, to extension for two additional five-year periods). Under the terms of the sublease agreement, Lamb\n\n38",
            "Table of Contents\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $296.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This was driven by our $135.6 million purchase of long-term investments, $89.1 million cash paid to acquire intellectual property, $44.3 million in capital expenditures including personnel-\n\nrelated costs associated with development of internal-use software, and $27.9 million net cash paid for our acquisition of Connect First, Inc.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $213.3 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to our $135.6 million purchase of long-term investments, an increase of $70.6 million in cash paid for the\n\nacquisition of intangible assets, and higher capital expenditures during 2019.\n\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\n\nOur primary financing activities have consisted of raising proceeds through the issuance of stock under our stock plans and issuance of our Notes.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was approximately $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily resulting from $15.2 million in proceeds from the issuance of shares in connection with our stock plans, net of taxes paid. This was partially offset by payments\n\nof $5.2 million of contingent consideration associated with acquisitions, and repayment of our financing obligation of $0.9 million.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, decreased by $388.2 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to proceeds from our Notes issued in 2018.\n\nBacklog\n\nWe have generally signed new customers to contracts that vary in length, from month-to-month to multi-year terms for our subscriptions. The timing of invoicing to our customers is a negotiated term and thus varies among our subscription contracts. Payment terms are generally billed either monthly or on an annual basis. At any point in the contract term, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice, which constitute backlog. Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, we do not recognize them as revenues, unearned revenues or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements. Given the variability in our contract length, we believe that backlog is not a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.\n\nDeferred Revenue\n\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of invoiced fees for our subscriptions, which we recognize as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. Customers with annual or multi-year contracts may opt for annual invoicing. For these customers, we generally invoice only one annual subscription period in advance. Therefore, our deferred revenue balance does not capture the full contract value of such multi-year contracts. Accordingly, we believe that deferred revenue is not a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize deferred revenue as a key management metric internally.\n\nContractual Obligations\n\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\n\nPayments due by period\n\nUp to 1 year\n\n1 to 3 years\n\n3 to 5 years\n\nMore than 5 years\n\nOperating lease obligations\n\n16,164\n\n19,812\n\n6,551\n\n5,883\n\nFinancing obligations\n\n2,956\n\n5,912\n\n—\n\n—\n\nLong-term debt\n\n—\n\n—\n\n460,000\n\n—\n\nPurchase obligations\n\n55,755\n\n16,220\n\n7,595\n\n17,649\n\nTotal\n\n74,875\n\n41,944\n\n474,146\n\n23,532\n\nPurchase obligations represent an estimate of open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the normal course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of December 31, 2019. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, except for our purchase orders with our inventory suppliers, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.

Volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was flat in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior-year period. This result reflected merchandising changes and price elasticity-related declines in certain brands, as well as isolated production challenges, partially offset by the continued benefit from momentum and innovation successes in the snacks businesses. Price/ mix was flat compared to the prior year as unfavorable mix, coupled with increases in brand building investments with retailers were offset by the impact of higher pricing. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC, which was completed in October 2017, contributed $41.3 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 results included $115.9 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $156.4 million of net sales related to this divested business.\n\nRefrigerated & Frozen net sales for fiscal 2019 were $2.80 billion, an increase of $51.0 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 1% increase in volume compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales volumes was a result of innovation across multiple brands, which was partially offset by the effects of reduced merchandising spend and the impact of a recall during the fourth quarter. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2018, as continued delivery of top-line accretive innovation in several brands was partially offset by brand building investments with retailers. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business, which was completed in February 2018, contributed $25.7 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition.\n\nInternational net sales for fiscal 2019 were $793.4 million, a decrease of $50.1 million, or 6%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 2% increase in volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, a 4% decrease due to foreign exchange rates, and a 2% increase in price/mix, in each case compared to fiscal 2018. The volume and price/ mix increases for fiscal 2019 were driven by growth in the Canadian snacks and frozen businesses. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $3.7 million to International net sales for fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 included $4.1 million of net sales related to our Del Monte® processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada, which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $48.9 million of net sales related to this divested business. In addition, fiscal 2019 and 2018 results included $17.1 million and $24.5 million, respectively, related to our divested Wesson® oil business.\n\nFoodservice net sales for fiscal 2019 were $934.2 million, a decrease of $120.6 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 14% decrease in volume, excluding divestitures. The decline in volume reflected the continued execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy and the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Price/mix increased 5% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in price/mix for fiscal 2019 reflected favorable product and customer mix, the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing, and the execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy. Fiscal 2019 included $34.2 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $53.4 million of net sales related to this divested business. Net sales declined by approximately 7% in fiscal 2019 due to the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility.\n\nPinnacle Foods net sales for fiscal 2019 (reflecting 213 days of Conagra Brands ownership) were $1.73 billion.

The $111.8 million increase consisted of a $72.8 million increase in Ceramic product line sales and a $39.0 million increase in Tantalum product line sales. Also contributing to the increase in net sales was a $30.6 million increase in OEM sales across the APAC, EMEA, and JPKO regions, and a $28.0 million increase in EMS sales across all regions. These increases in net sales were partially offset by a $3.2 million decrease in distributor sales in the JPKO region and a $2.7 million decrease in OEM sales in the Americas region. In addition, Solid Capacitors net sales was unfavorably impacted by $0.5 million from foreign currency exchange due to the change in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe increase in Film and Electrolytic net sales was primarily driven by a $10.5 million increase in distributor sales\n\nacross the Americas and EMEA regions. Also contributing to the increase in net sales was $1.7 million increase in EMS sales in the Americas region and a $0.8 million increase in OEM sales in the JPKO region. These increases in net sales were partially offset by a $5.6 million decrease in OEM sales across the APAC and EMEA regions and a $3.1 million decrease in distributor sales across the APAC and JPKO regions.

As of December 31, 2019, and 2018, we recorded deferred tax assets related to certain U.S. state and non-U.S. income tax loss carryforwards of $4,724 and $4,647, respectively, and U.S. and non- U.S. tax credits of $15,964 and $16,909, respectively. The deferred tax assets expire in various years primarily between 2021 and 2039.\n\nGenerally, we assess if it is more-likely-than-not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized during the available carry-forward periods. As a result, we have determined that valuation allowances of $8,011 and $8,274 should be provided for certain deferred tax assets at December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the valuation allowances relate to certain U.S. state and non-U.S. loss carry-forwards and certain U.S. state tax credits that management does not anticipate will be utilized.\n\nNo valuation allowance was recorded in 2019 against the U.S. federal foreign tax credit carryforwards of $5,785, which expire in varying amounts between 2023 and 2029 as well as the research and development tax credits of $7,495, which expire in varying amounts between 2021 and 2039.

We also present Free Cash Flow, which is a non-U.S. GAAP measure, defined as (i) net cash from operating activities plus (ii) net cash used in investing activities, excluding payment for purchases (and proceeds from the sale) of marketable securities, and net cash variation for joint ventures deconsolidation, which are considered as temporary financial investments. The result of this definition is ultimately net cash from operating activities plus payment for purchase and proceeds from sale of tangible, intangible and financial assets, proceeds received in the sale of businesses and cash paid for business acquisitions. We believe Free Cash Flow, a non-U.S. GAAP measure, provides useful information for investors and management because it measures our capacity to generate cash from our operating and investing activities to sustain our operations. Free Cash Flow is not a U.S. GAAP measure and does not represent total cash flow since it does not include the cash flows generated by or used in financing activities. Free Cash Flow reconciles with the total cash flow and the net cash increase (decrease) by including the payment for purchases (and proceeds from the sale) of marketable securities and net cash variation from joint ventures deconsolidation, the net cash from (used in) financing activities and the effect of changes in exchange rates. In addition, our definition of Free Cash Flow may differ from definitions used by other companies.

Our planned capital projects will provide both new and expanded facilities and improvements to our technology that we believe will produce increased efficiency and the capacity to continue to support the growth of our customer base.\n\nCash Flows\n\nFiscal Year Ended\n\nDecember 27, 2019\n\nDecember 28, 2018\n\nDecember 29, 2017\n\nNet income\n\n$\n\n24,193 $\n\n20,402 $\n\n14,366\n\nNon-cash charges\n\n$\n\n47,625 $\n\n38,186 $\n\n28,725\n\nChanges in working capital\n\n$\n\n(26,811) $\n\n(13,506) $\n\n(11,594)\n\nCash provided by operating activities\n\n$\n\n45,007 $\n\n45,082 $\n\n31,497\n\nCash used in investing activities\n\n$\n\n(44,154) $\n\n(33,688) $\n\n(42,406)\n\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities\n\n$\n\n96,947 $\n\n(10,442) $\n\n19,429\n\nFiscal Year 2019 Cash Flows\n\nNet cash provided by operations was $45.0 million for fiscal 2019 consisting of $24.2 million of net income and $47.6 million of non-cash charges, partially offset by an increase in working capital of $26.8 million. The increase in non-cash charges of $9.4 million is primarily driven by changes in the fair value of earn-out liabilities of $4.4 million and higher depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in working capital of $26.8 million is a result of organic growth and acquisitions and includes $1.8 million of earn-out liability payments classified as operating activities.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $44.2 million in fiscal 2019 driven by $16.1 million in capital expenditures which included implementations of our Enterprise Resource Planning system and the buildouts of our headquarters in Ridgefield, CT and distribution center in Dallas, Texas. The Company used $28.1 million in cash to fund acquisitions, the most significant of which was Bassian.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $96.9 million for fiscal 2019 driven by $145.0 million of net proceeds received from the issuance of our Senior Notes, partially offset by $44.2 million to settle all borrowings outstanding on our ABL and $2.4 million of earn-out liability payments classified as financing activities.\n\n",

Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, consisting of net loss of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $26.2 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $16.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $10.0 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an outflow from the changes in accrued liabilities and other of $5.9 million and inventory of $5.6 million, partially offset by an inflow from changes in deferred revenue of $3.2 million.\n\nThe unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and other was driven by an increase in lease liabilities associated with the lease of the San Jose corporate office. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to build up of inventory and timing of shipments, partially offset by increased reserves. The favorable change in deferred revenues was primarily driven by increased bookings.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million, consisting of net loss of $27.6 million which includes payments for our internal investigation costs of $8.6 million, non-cash charges of $25.0 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.9 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $3.1 million, offset primarily by an outflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $6.1 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and inventory of $1.5 million.\n\nThe favorable change in deferred revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the sale of subscription and support. The favorable change in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, increased value added tax accrual due to timing of payments, and an increase in legal fees accrual. The unfavorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections. The unfavorable change in prepaid and other assets was mainly driven by the increase in deferred sales commissions due to higher deferred revenue and higher average commission rate. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to the timing of shipments.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $14.3 million, consisting of a net loss of $10.8 million, a cash decrease resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million and non-cash charges of $26.4 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $17.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance of $1.1 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $12.4 million and deferred revenue of $3.0 million, and an outflow from the change in accrued liabilities of $8.9 million, inventory of $4.7 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and accounts payable of $0.9 million.\n\n"

            "Company’s consolidated income statements. In accordance with ASC 842, the Company determined if an arrangement was a lease at inception based on whetherthere is an identified asset, whether the Company has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset and whether the Companyhas the right to direct the use of the asset. As of December 31, 2019, the Company only has operating leases and does not have any financing leases. Operatinglease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. Leaseexpense for minimum lease payments was recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. See Note 9 for further disclosures regarding the Company’soperating leases.Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”). ASU 2019-12 is intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes by, among other things, eliminating certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod taxallocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences.ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, the Company must apply certainaspects of this standard retrospectively for all periods presented while other aspects are applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effectadjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on itsconsolidated financial statements.In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments(“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 is intended to provide more decision-useful information about expected credit losses on financial instruments and othercommitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The main provisions include presenting financial assets measured at amortized costat the amount expected to be collected, which is net of an allowance for expected credit losses, and recording credit losses related to available-for-sale securitiesthrough an allowance for credit losses. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and must be appliedusing a modified retrospective approach with earlier adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company does not expect theadoption of this amendment to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.4. REVENUEThe Company adopted ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. The Company recognized the cumulative effect ofinitially applying ASC 606, which was immaterial, as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative prior period information isaccounted for in accordance with the previous revenue guidance, ASC 605, and has not been restated. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company recognizesrevenue under the core principle to depict the transfer of control to the Company’s customers in an amount reflecting the consideration the Company expects to beentitled. In order to achieve that core principle, the Company applies the following five step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify theperformance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5)recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.Revenue for product sales is recognized at the point in time when control transfers to the Company’s customers, which is generally when products areshipped from the Company’s manufacturing facilities or when delivered to the customer’s named location. When the Company performs shipping and handlingactivities after the transfer of control to the customer (e.g., when control transfers prior to delivery), they are considered to be fulfillment activities, andaccordingly, the costs are accrued for when the related revenue is recognized. Taxes collected on behalf of customers relating to product sales and remitted togovernmental authorities, principally sales taxes, are excluded from revenue.",
            "NETWORK-1 TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\n\nNOTE B – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\n\nRevenue disaggregated by source is as follows:\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nFully-Paid Licenses\n\n$\n\n130,000 (1)\n\n$\n\n12,700,000\n\nRoyalty Bearing Licenses\n\n2,907,000\n\n3,086,000\n\nOther Revenue\n\nTotal Revenue\n\n$\n\n― 3,037,000\n\n$\n\n6,320,000 (2)\n\n22,106,000\n\n__________________________ (1)\n\nIncludes conversion of an existing royalty bearing license to a fully-paid license.\n\n(2) Revenue from the sale of the Company’s unsecured claim against Avaya, Inc. to an unaffiliated third party (see Note K[1] hereof).\n\nThe Company relies on royalty reports received from third party licensees to record its revenue. From time to time, the Company may audit or otherwise dispute royalties reported from licensees. Any adjusted royalty revenue as a result of such audits or dispute is recorded by the Company in the period in which such adjustment is agreed to by the Company and the licensee or otherwise determined.\n\nRevenue from the Company’s patent licensing business is generated from negotiated license agreements. The timing and amount of revenue recognized from each licensee depends upon a variety of factors, including the terms of each agreement and the nature of the obligations of the parties. These agreements may include, but not be limited to, elements related to past infringement liabilities, non-refundable upfront license fees, and ongoing royalties on licensed products sold by the licensee. Generally, in the event of settlement of litigation related to the Company’s assertion of patent infringement involving its intellectual property, defendants will either pay (i) a non-refundable lump sum payment for a non-exclusive fully-paid license (a “Fully-Paid License”), or (ii) a non-refundable lump sum payment (license initiation fee) together with an ongoing obligation to pay quarterly or monthly royalties to the Company for the life of the licensed patent (a “Royalty Bearing License”).\n\nThe Company’s license agreements, both Fully-Paid Licenses and Royalty Bearing Licenses, typically include some combination of the following: (i) the grant of a non- exclusive license to manufacture and/or sell products covered by its patented technologies; (ii) the release of the licensee from certain claims, and (iii) the dismissal of any pending litigation. The intellectual property rights granted pursuant to these licenses typically extend until the expiration of the related patents. Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, the Company typically has no further performance obligations with respect to the grant of the non-exclusive licenses. Generally, the license agreements provide for the grant of the licenses, releases, and other obligations following execution of the agreement and the receipt of the up-front lump sum payment for a Fully-Paid License or a license initiation fee for a Royalty Bearing License.\n\nOngoing Royalty Payments: Certain of the Company’s revenue from Royalty Bearing Licenses results from the calculation of royalties based on a licensee’s actual quarterly sales (one licensee pays monthly royalties) of licensed products, applied to a contractual royalty rate. Licensees that pay royalties on a quarterly basis generally report to the Company actual quarterly sales and related quarterly royalties due within 45 days after the end of the quarter in which such sales activity takes place. Licensees with Royalty Bearing Licenses are obligated to provide the Company with quarterly (or monthly) royalty reports that summarize their sales of licensed products and their related royalty obligations to the Company. The Company receives these royalty reports subsequent to the period in which its licensees underlying sales occurred. The amount of royalties due under Royalty Bearing Licenses, each quarter, cannot be reasonably estimated by management.\n\nConsequently, the Company recognizes revenue for the period in which the royalty report is received in arrears and other revenue recognition criteria are met.\n\n",
            "The Company’s software license arrangements with its customers often include multiple promises to transfer licensed software products and services. Determining whether the products and/or services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment.\n\nThe Company’s SaaS and PaaS arrangements may include variable consideration in the form of usage-based fees. If the arrangement that includes variable consideration in the form of usage-based fees does not meet the allocation exception for variable consideration, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration at the outset of the arrangement using either the expected value or most likely amount method, depending on the specifics of each arrangement. These estimates are constrained to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of incremental revenue will not occur and are updated each reporting period as additional information becomes available.\n\nJudgment is used in determining: (1) whether the financing component in a software license agreement is significant and, if so, (2) the discount rate used in calculating the significant financing component. The Company assesses the significance of the financing component based on the ratio of license fees paid over time to total license fees. If determined to be significant, the financing component is calculated using a rate that discounts the license fees to the cash selling price.\n\nJudgment is also used in assessing whether the extension of payment terms in a software license arrangement results in variable consideration and, if so, the amount to be included in the transaction price. The Company applies the portfolio approach to estimating the amount of variable consideration in these arrangements using the most likely amount method that is based on the Company’s historical collection experience under similar arrangements.\n\nSignificant judgment is required to determine the SSP for each performance obligation, the amount allocated to each performance obligation and whether it depicts the amount that the Company expects to receive in exchange for the related product and/or service. As the selling prices of the Company’s software licenses are highly variable, the Company estimates SSP of its software licenses using the residual approach when the software license is sold with other services and observable SSPs exist for the other services. The Company uses a range of amounts to estimate SSP for maintenance and services. These ranges are based on stand-alone sales and vary based on the type of service and geographic region. If the SSP of a performance obligation is not directly observable, the Company will maximize observable inputs to determine its SSP.\n\nContract Balances\n\nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. The Company records an accrued receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing and the Company’s right to consideration only requires the passage of time, or deferred revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing.\n\nTotal receivables represent amounts billed and amounts earned that are to be billed in the future (i.e., accrued receivables). Included in accrued receivables are services and SaaS and PaaS revenues earned in the current period but billed in the following period and amounts due under multi-year software license arrangements with extended payment terms for which the Company has an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment subsequent to invoicing.\n\nTotal receivables, net is comprised of the following (in thousands):\n\nDecember 31,\n\nBilled receivables Allowance for doubtful accounts\n\nBilled receivables, net\n\nAccrued receivables Significant financing component\n\nTotal accrued receivables, net Less: current accrued receivables Less: current significant financing component\n\nTotal long-term accrued receivables, net\n\n$\n\n2019 213,654 $ (5,149 ) 208,505 399,302 (35,569 ) 363,733 161,714 (11,022 ) 213,041 572,238 $\n\n2018 239,275 (3,912 ) 235,363 336,858 (35,029 ) 301,829 123,053 (10,234 ) 189,010 537,192\n\nTotal receivables, net\n\n$\n\nNo customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated receivables balance as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\n"

            "GLOSSARY ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES – continued\n\nEBITDA: TORM defines EBITDA as earnings before financial income and expenses, depreciation, impairment, amortization and taxes. The computation of EBITDA refers to financial income and expenses which the Company deems to be equivalent to “interest” for purposes of presenting EBITDA. Financial expenses consist of interest on borrowings, losses on foreign exchange transactions and bank charges. Financial income consists of interest income and gains on foreign exchange transactions.\n\nEBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by Management and external users of financial statements, such as lenders, to assess TORM's operating performance as well as compliance with the financial covenants and restrictions contained in the Company's financing agreements. TORM believes that EBITDA assists Management and investors by increasing comparability of the Company's performance from period to period. This increased comparability is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects of interest, depreciation, impairment, amortization and taxes. These are items that could be affected by various changing financing methods and capital structure and which may significantly affect profit/(loss) between periods. Including EBITDA as a measure benefits investors in selecting between investment alternatives.\n\nEBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect profit/(loss), and these measures may vary among other companies and not be directly comparable.

            "Contingencies\n\nWe evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with\n\nthe authoritative guidance on contingencies. We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes from potential claims or proceedings, as well as potential ranges of probable losses, when the outcomes of the claims or proceedings are probable and reasonably estimable. A determination of the amount of an accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after the analysis of each separate matter. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, we base our estimates on the information available at the time of our assessment. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates.\n\nNote 2. Recent Accounting Standards\n\nRecently adopted authoritative guidance\n\nRevenue Recognition — Contracts with Customers. In May 2014, the FASB issued new authoritative guidance for revenue from contracts with customers. The standard’s core principle is that a company recognizes revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, companies are required to capitalize certain contract acquisition costs, including commissions paid, when contracts are signed. The asset recognized from capitalized incremental and recoverable acquisition costs is amortized on a straight-line basis consistent with the timing of transfer of the products or services to which the asset relates.\n\nAs a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance, our net revenue for fiscal\n\n2019 increased $47 million, and our operating expenses decreased $12 million. See Note 3 for additional information related to the impact of the new guidance on the timing and amounts of revenues recognized in fiscal 2019.\n\nThe effects of the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance on our March 29, 2019\n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:\n\n(In millions)\n\nAs Reported\n\nAs of March 29, 2019 Balances Without Adoption of New Standard\n\nEffect of Change\n\nAccounts receivable, net Other current assets (1) Other long-term assets (2) Total assets\n\n$ $ $ $\n\n708 435 1,262 15,938\n\n$ $ $ $\n\n657 421 1,213 15,824\n\n$ $ $ $\n\n51 14 49 114\n\nShort-term contract liabilities Other current liabilities Long-term contract liabilities Deferred income tax liabilities Total liabilities\n\n$ $ $ $ $\n\n2,320 533 736 577 10,200\n\n$ $ $ $ $\n\n2,437 494 837 526 10,328\n\n$ $ $ $ $\n\n(117) 39 (101) 51 (128)\n\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss Retained earnings Total stockholders’ equity\n\n$ $ $\n\n(7) $ $ $\n\n933 5,738\n\n(2) $ $ $\n\n686 5,496\n\n(5) 247 242\n\n(1)\n\nAs reported includes short-term deferred commissions of $92 million.

In accordance with ASC 842, the Company determined if an arrangement was a lease at inception based on whetherthere is an identified asset, whether the Company has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset and whether the Companyhas the right to direct the use of the asset. As of December 31, 2019, the Company only has operating leases and does not have any financing leases. Operatinglease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. Leaseexpense for minimum lease payments was recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. See Note 9 for further disclosures regarding the Company’soperating leases.Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”). ASU 2019-12 is intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes by, among other things, eliminating certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod taxallocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences.ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, the Company must apply certainaspects of this standard retrospectively for all periods presented while other aspects are applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effectadjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on itsconsolidated financial statements.In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments(“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 is intended to provide more decision-useful information about expected credit losses on financial instruments and othercommitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The main provisions include presenting financial assets measured at amortized costat the amount expected to be collected, which is net of an allowance for expected credit losses, and recording credit losses related to available-for-sale securitiesthrough an allowance for credit losses. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and must be appliedusing a modified retrospective approach with earlier adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company does not expect theadoption of this amendment to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.4. REVENUEThe Company adopted ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. The Company recognized the cumulative effect ofinitially applying ASC 606, which was immaterial, as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative prior period information isaccounted for in accordance with the previous revenue guidance, ASC 605, and has not been restated. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company recognizesrevenue under the core principle to depict the transfer of control to the Company’s customers in an amount reflecting the consideration the Company expects to beentitled. In order to achieve that core principle, the Company applies the following five step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify theperformance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5)recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.Revenue for product sales is recognized at the point in time when control transfers to the Company’s customers, which is generally when products areshipped from the Company’s manufacturing facilities or when delivered to the customer’s named location. When the Company performs shipping and handlingactivities after the transfer of control to the customer (e.g., when control transfers prior to delivery), they are considered to be fulfillment activities, andaccordingly, the costs are accrued for when the related revenue is recognized. Taxes collected on behalf of customers relating to product sales and remitted togovernmental authorities, principally sales taxes, are excluded from revenue.",

Until the end of the first quarter of 2018, we were involved in ongoing maintenance and support for these solutions until customers transitioned to other platforms. No disposal gains or losses were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to these discontinued solutions.

Business Segments\n\nWe primarily derive our revenues from sales of our proprietary software (either as a direct license sale or under a subscription delivery model), which\n\nalso serves as the basis for our recurring service contracts for software support and maintenance and certain transaction-related services. In addition, we provide various other client services, including installation, and managed services such as outsourcing, private cloud hosting and revenue cycle management.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, we realigned our reporting structure as a result of the divestiture of our investment in Netsmart on December 31,\n\n2018, the evolution of the healthcare IT industry and our increased focus on the payer and life sciences market. As a result, we changed the presentation of our reportable segments to Provider and Veradigm. The new Provider segment is comprised of our core integrated clinical software applications, financial management and patient engagement solutions targeted at clients across the entire continuum of care. The new Veradigm segment primarily focuses on the payer and life sciences market. These changes to our reportable segments had no impact on operating segments. The segment disclosures below for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 have been revised to our current presentation.\n\nWe sold all of our investment in Netsmart on December 31, 2018. Prior to the sale, Netsmart comprised a separate reportable segment, which due to its significance to our historical consolidated financial statements and results of operations, is reported as a discontinued operation as a result of the sale. In addition, the results of operations related to two of the product offerings acquired with the EIS Business (Horizon Clinicals and Series2000) are also presented throughout these financial statements as discontinued operations and are included within the Provider reportable segment, except for acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments, which are included in “Unallocated Amounts”. Refer to Note 17, “Discontinued Operations.”\n\nAs a result of the above changes, as of December 31, 2019, we had eight operating segments, which are aggregated into two reportable segments. The\n\nProvider reportable segment includes the Hospitals and Health Systems, Ambulatory, CarePort, FollowMyHealth®, EPSiTM, EIS-Classics and 2bPrecise strategic business units, each of which represents a separate operating segment. This reportable segment derives its revenue from the sale of integrated clinical software applications, financial management and patient engagement solutions, which primarily include EHR-related software, connectivity and coordinated care solutions, financial and practice management software, related installation, support and maintenance, outsourcing, private cloud hosting, revenue cycle management, training and electronic claims administration services. The Veradigm reportable segment is comprised of the Veradigm business unit, which represents a separate operating segment. This reportable segment provides data-driven clinical insights with actionable tools for clinical workflow, research, analytics and media. Its solutions, targeted at key healthcare stakeholders, help improve the quality, efficiency and value of healthcare delivery.\n\n104\n\n10,949 1,044 11,993\n\n2,918 261 3,179 8,814 1,148\n\n7,666 (2,990)\n\n",

Average headcount during fiscal year 2019,however, increased by 54 as compared to average headcount during fiscal year 2018, primarily due to the Cyence acquisition that closed on November 1, 2017,which resulted in increased personnel costs, despite the decrease in headcount as of the end of fiscal year 2019 versus the end of fiscal year 2018.We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to hire and dedicate internal resources to developing,improving, and expanding the functionality of our solutions and migrating our solutions to the cloud. Research and development expenses may also increase if wepursue additional acquisitions.Sales and MarketingOur sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for our sales and marketing employees.

Professional services were higher in the prior year period as a result of professional services incurred in connection with our acquisition of Cyence andimplementation costs of a new enterprise resource planning platform and a new product configuration and quoting system.Our general and administrative headcount was 298 as of July 31, 2019 compared with 255 as of July 31, 2018.

            "decrease in distributor sales across the APAC and JPKO regions and a $3.8 million decrease in OEM sales across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions.\n\nReportable Segment Operating Income\n\nSegment operating income of $22.5 million in fiscal year 2019 increased $6.9 million from $15.7 million in fiscal year\n\n2018. The increase in operating income was primarily due to a $6.6 million decrease in SG&A expenses resulting from a decrease in payroll expenses that was caused by a reduction in head count. Also contributing to the increase in operating income was a $2.9 million decrease in restructuring charges, a $1.3 million decrease in net loss on write down and disposal of long-lived assets, and a $0.2 million decrease in R&D expenses. Partially offsetting these improvements was a $4.1 million decrease in gross margin, which was primarily driven by a change in the sales mix to lower margin products.\n\nConsolidated Comparison of Fiscal Year 2018 to Fiscal Year 2017\n\nNet sales\n\nNet sales of $1.2 billion for fiscal year 2018 increased 58.5% from $757.3 million for fiscal year 2017. Solid Capacitor and Film and Electrolytic sales increased by $196.1 million and $19.7 million, respectively and net sales for MSA, our new reportable segment in fiscal year 2018, was $227.0 million. Prior to the acquisition of TOKIN on April 19, 2017, the Company did not have any MSA sales.\n\nThe increase in Solid Capacitors net sales was primarily driven by the addition of net sales of $133.8 million resulting from the TOKIN acquisition and an increase in net sales to the legacy products distributor channel of $81.7 million. To a lesser degree, an increase in legacy Ceramic products' net sales of $6.0 million in the EMS channel across all regions and $10.2 million in the OEM channel in the EMEA and APAC regions also contributed to the increase in Solid Capacitors net sales. These increases were partially offset by a $28.0 million decrease in net sales in the OEM channel for legacy Tantalum products across all regions. In addition, Solid Capacitors net sales was favorably impacted by $6.1 million from foreign currency exchange due to the change in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe increase in Film and Electrolytic net sales was driven by an increase in net sales in the distributor channel across the APAC and EMEA regions of $13.7 million, and to a lesser degree, a $3.3 million increase in net sales in the OEM channel of the EMEA region and a $4.2 million increase in the EMS channel across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of $1.2 million in the OEM channel across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions. In addition, there was a favorable impact of $7.6 million from foreign currency exchange primarily due to the change in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar.\n\nIn fiscal years 2018 and 2017, net sales by region were as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nFiscal Year 2018\n\nFiscal Year 2017\n\nNet Sales\n\n% of Total\n\nNet Sales\n\n% of Total\n\nAPAC EMEA Americas JPKO\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n$\n\n479,987 277,898 259,105 183,191 1,200,181\n\n40.0% $ 23.1% 21.6% 15.3%\n\n$\n\n288,764 237,437 224,056 7,081 757,338\n\n38.1% 31.4% 29.6% 0.9%\n\nIn fiscal years 2018 and 2017, the percentages of net sales by channel to total net sales were as follows:\n\nFiscal Year 2018\n\nFiscal Year 2017\n\nNet Sales\n\n% of Total\n\nNet Sales\n\n% of Total\n\nOEM Distributors EMS\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n$\n\n563,495 470,324 166,362 1,200,181\n\n46.9% $ 39.2% 13.9%\n\n$\n\n246,397 354,639 156,302 757,338\n\n32.5% 46.8% 20.7%\n\nGross Margin\n\nGross margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 of $339.4 million (28.3% of net sales) increased $154.0 million\n\nor 83.1% from $185.4 million (24.5% of net sales) in the prior fiscal year.

These PRSUs have both a service and performance-based vestingcondition and awards are divided into three equal tranches and vest based on achieving certain adjusted earnings per share growth metrics. The service conditionrequires participants to be employed on May 15th of the following year once the performance condition has been met. Depending on the actual performanceachieved, a participant may earn between 0% to 300% of the targeted shares for each tranche, which is determined based on a straight-line interpolation appliedfor the achievement between the specified performance ranges.

            "Table of Contents\n\nOn June 7, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner upheld U.S. Treasury Department regulations requiring that related parties in a cost-sharing arrangement share expenses related to stock-based compensation in proportion to the economic activity of the parties. The ruling reversed the prior decision of the U.S. Tax Court. On November 12, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the plaintiff’s request for an en banc rehearing. Based on the appellate court’s ruling, the Company recorded a cumulative income tax expense of $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The plaintiff filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court on February 10, 2020, and the Company will continue to monitor developments in this matter.\n\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets were as follows (in thousands):\n\nDecember 31,\n\n2019\n\nDeferred tax assets:\n\nNet operating losses and credits\n\n$\n\n113,475 $\n\nFixed assets and intangible assets\n\n61,932\n\nAccruals and reserves\n\n75,133\n\nStock-based compensation\n\n8,615\n\nInventory\n\n429\n\nOther\n\n5,287\n\nTotal deferred tax assets\n\n264,871\n\nLess: valuation allowance\n\n(244,581)\n\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance\n\n20,290\n\nDeferred tax liabilities:\n\nAccruals and reserves\n\n(15,525)\n\nOther\n\n(914)\n\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n\n(16,439)\n\nNet deferred tax assets\n\n$\n\n3,851 $\n\nThe Company accounts for deferred taxes under ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”) which involves weighing positive and negative evidence concerning the realizability of the Company’s deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction. The Company evaluated its ability to realize the benefit of its net deferred tax assets and weighed all available positive and negative evidence both objective and subjective in nature. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the weight given to positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. Consideration was given to negative evidence such as: the duration and severity of losses in prior years, high seasonal revenue concentrations, increasing competitive pressures, and a challenging retail environment. Realization of the Company’s net deferred tax assets is dependent upon its generation of sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income change.\n\nThe Company recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the net amount that the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has a valuation allowance of $191.7 million against its U.S. deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance of $52.9 million against certain of its foreign deferred tax assets that the Company is not expected to realize. The Company will continue to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets in each of the applicable jurisdictions going forward.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company has U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $316.2 million which expire beginning after 2032, California net operating loss carryforwards of $57.3 million which expire beginning after 2032, and other states net operating loss carryforwards of $52.1 million which expire beginning after 2023. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has U.S. federal research tax credit carryforwards of approximately $22.6 million, which if not utilized, begin to expire after 2031, California research tax credit carryforwards of approximately $45.0 million, which do not expire, Massachusetts research tax credit carryforwards of approximately $2.9 million, which if not utilized, begin to expire after 2028,\n\n98\n\n2018\n\n61,494\n\n55,476\n\n53,818\n\n9,494\n\n911\n\n4,806\n\n185,999\n\n(181,122)\n\n4,877\n\n—\n\n(560)\n\n(560)\n\n",

All of the NOL carryforward was incurred subsequent to the enactment of the TCJA and therefore has an indefinite carryforward period. The Company has significant deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to property, plant and equipment, which are expected to reverse and allow for the full utilization of the NOL carryforward. As such, the Company has not recorded a valuation allowance related to the NOL carryforward. Also included in the deferred tax assets are North Carolina Investing in Business Property Credit and North Carolina Jobs Credits totaling $4.9 million, as well as Georgia Job Tax Credits totaling $2.6 million. The North Carolina Investing in Business Property Credit provides a 7% investment tax credit for property located in a North Carolina development area, the North Carolina Creating Jobs Credit provides a tax credit for increased employment in North Carolina, and the Georgia Job Tax Credit provides a tax credit for creation and retention of qualifying jobs in Georgia. It is management’s opinion that the majority of the North Carolina and Georgia income tax credits will not be utilized before they expire, and a $5.6 million valuation allowance has been recorded as of October 31, 2019.

Significant estimates include the rebates related to revenue recognition, stock based compensation and the valuation of inventory, long-lived assets, finite lived intangible assets and goodwill. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements: In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. There have been further amendments, including practical expedients, with the issuance of ASU 2018-01 in January 2018, ASU 2018-11 in July 2018 and ASU 2018-20 in December 2018. The amended guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those reporting periods, with early adoption permitted. The guidance will be applied on a modified retrospective basis with the earliest period presented. Based on the effective date, this guidance will apply beginning October 1, 2019. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have no impact to retained earnings or net income. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02 on October 1, 2019, we anticipate recording a right-of-use asset and an offsetting lease liability of approximately $2.3 to $2.9 million.\n\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 Intangibles-Goodwill, which offers amended guidance to simplify the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. A goodwill impairment will now be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This guidance is to be applied on a prospective basis effective for the Company’s interim and annual periods beginning after January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted for any impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. The Company does not believe the adoption of this ASU will have a material impact on our financial statements.\n\n36\n\n2017 3,847,839 13,532,375 128,431 13,660,806\n\n0.28 0.",

Interest income increased due to higher interest rates. Other expense in the year ended December 31, 2018, was driven by foreign currency translation losses mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro. Other income in the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven mainly by foreign currency translation gains due to the depreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro.\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nEffective tax rate\n\n19.9%\n\nThe effective income tax rate in 2018 was 19.9% compared to 64.1% in the prior year. The tax rate in 2018 was favorably impacted by a discrete one-time rate change benefit related to the Tax Act resulting from the election of tax accounting method changes, partially offset by a one-time withholding tax on repatriation of earnings from one of our foreign subsidiaries that was completed during the year to enable the use of tax credits due to expire in 2018. The tax rate in 2017 was unfavorably impacted by the application of the Tax Act, driven by the remeasurement of the net deferred tax assets from 35% to 21% and the one-time mandatory transition tax on the historical earnings of foreign affiliates, which resulted in a net non-cash charge of $18,001.\n\nNet earnings were $46,532 or $1.39 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to earnings of $14,448 or $0.43 per diluted share in the comparable period of 2017.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $100,241 at December 31, 2019, and $100,933 at December 31, 2018, of which $98,309 and $96,762, respectively, were held outside the United States. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $692 was primarily driven by cash generated from operating activities of $64,405 and net proceeds from an increase in borrowings of long-term debt of $49,700, which were offset by the payment for the QTI acquisition of $73,906, capital expenditures of $21,733, treasury stock purchases of $11,746, dividends paid of $5,238, and taxes paid on behalf of equity award participants of $2,657. Total debt as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, was $99,700 and $50,000, respectively. Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, defined as long-term debt as a percentage of total debt and shareholders’ equity, was 19.7% at December 31, 2019, compared to 11.7% at December 31, 2018.\n\nWorking capital increased by $5,164 from December 31, 2018, to December 31, 2019, driven mainly by the decrease in accrued payroll and benefits due to lower short-term incentive compensation and the decrease in accounts payable, which were partially offset by an increase in operating lease obligations.\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $64,405 during the year ended December 31, 2019. Components of net cash provided by operating activities included net earnings of $36,146, depreciation and amortization expense of $24,619, stock-based compensation of $5,015, other net non-cash items totaling $5,160, and a net cash outflow from changes in assets and liabilities of $6,535.\n\nCTS CORPORATION 21\n\n(3,343)\n\n1,284\n\n3,817\n\n1,758\n\n64.",

The SIP shareholders are entitled to dividends over the Vesting Period. There are no performance conditions applicable to the vesting of SIP shares.

Options exercised prior to the vesting date relate to those attributable to good leavers as defined by the scheme rules.\n\nPerformance Share Plan The Group operates a Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) for Executive Directors, the Operating Leadership Team and certain key employees. The extent to which awards vest will depend upon the Group’s performance over the three-year period following the award date. Both market based and non-market based performance conditions may be attached to the options, for which an appropriate adjustment is made when calculating the fair value of an option. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire. Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest, unless under exceptional circumstances.\n\nOn 17 August 2018, the Group awarded 452,695 nil cost options under the PSP scheme. For the 2018 awards, the Group’s performance is measured by reference to the growth in Operating profit (75% of the award) and growth in Revenue (25% of the award) over the three-year period April 2018 – March 2021. For previous awards, the Group’s performance had been measured by reference to the cumulative profit measure (Underlying operating profit for 2015 and 2016 awards, and Operating profit for 2017 awards) and total shareholder return relative to the FTSE 250 share index.\n\n"

Average headcount during fiscal year 2019,however, increased by 54 as compared to average headcount during fiscal year 2018, primarily due to the Cyence acquisition that closed on November 1, 2017,which resulted in increased personnel costs, despite the decrease in headcount as of the end of fiscal year 2019 versus the end of fiscal year 2018.We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to hire and dedicate internal resources to developing,improving, and expanding the functionality of our solutions and migrating our solutions to the cloud.

Professional services were higher in the prior year period as a result of professional services incurred in connection with our acquisition of Cyence andimplementation costs of a new enterprise resource planning platform and a new product configuration and quoting system.Our general and administrative headcount was 298 as of July 31, 2019 compared with 255 as of July 31, 2018.

Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, consisting of net loss of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $26.2 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $16.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $10.0 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an outflow from the changes in accrued liabilities and other of $5.9 million and inventory of $5.6 million, partially offset by an inflow from changes in deferred revenue of $3.2 million.\n\nThe unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and other was driven by an increase in lease liabilities associated with the lease of the San Jose corporate office. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to build up of inventory and timing of shipments, partially offset by increased reserves. The favorable change in deferred revenues was primarily driven by increased bookings.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million, consisting of net loss of $27.6 million which includes payments for our internal investigation costs of $8.6 million, non-cash charges of $25.0 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.9 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $3.1 million, offset primarily by an outflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $6.1 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and inventory of $1.5 million.\n\nThe favorable change in deferred revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the sale of subscription and support. The favorable change in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, increased value added tax accrual due to timing of payments, and an increase in legal fees accrual. The unfavorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections. The unfavorable change in prepaid and other assets was mainly driven by the increase in deferred sales commissions due to higher deferred revenue and higher average commission rate. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to the timing of shipments.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $14.3 million, consisting of a net loss of $10.8 million, a cash decrease resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million and non-cash charges of $26.4 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $17.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance of $1.1 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $12.4 million and deferred revenue of $3.0 million, and an outflow from the change in accrued liabilities of $8.9 million, inventory of $4.7 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and accounts payable of $0.9 million.\n\n",

Competitors in the transmission business consist mainly of a small number of large multinational companies, increasingly joined by smaller, fast-growing manufacturers in emerging coun- tries including China, India and Korea.\n\nSeveral trends are affecting the businesses of the Operating Com- pany. In the power generation business, the ongoing strong growth in demand for power from renewable sources – which come with associated short-term fluctuations in power genera- tion levels – is shifting market demand from fossil baseload gen- eration to more flexible, highly efficient and affordable gas power plants with low emissions, in particular in Europe, Latin America and Asia. A second trend is that the development and execution of large projects increasingly requires financing by the OEM, in- cluding equity participation. For Gas and Power, this role is ful- filled by Financial Services, which can offer customers a range of financing and equity options backed by domain know-how. In general, the markets for the Operating Company are strongly af- fected by changes in national energy regulations, such as support of renewable energy, the security of supply through capacity mar- kets or strategic reserve capacity, carbon pricing and climate change targets, and modernization of energy and electricity mar- kets. Fuel efficiency standards in the U. S. and the European Union are expected to weigh on future demand for fossil transportation fuels in these regions, contrasting with strong growth in transpor- tation-related fuel use in other world regions, particularly in Asia.\n\nIn Oil and Gas, the role of natural gas compared to other fossil fuels is growing from the mid- to long-term perspective, facili- tated by its lower carbon footprint. Furthermore, declining pro- duction from maturing oil and gas fields, or depletion, requires improved recovery technologies as well as additional mechanical and electrical power, necessitating continuous investments. At the same time, oil and gas companies increasingly focus on asset economics and emission footprint, requiring products and solu- tions offering an improved balance of high asset productivity with safety and environmental performance. Generally, our oil and gas business benefits from these major market trends. At the same time, our diversified and global presence across the oil and gas value chain and other industries – each following their own business cycles – offers stable opportunities for our business.\n\nThe transmission business generally benefits from major trends and changes in global electrical power systems, in particular decarbonization, digitalization and global electrification. Decar- bonization is shifting the focus of generation to both central and decentral renewables. This shift increases demand for offshore connectivity and grid stability, requiring environmentally friendly products and systems. The integration of wind power, photo- voltaics, biomass, storage and other intermittent or distributed energy resources into efficient and reliable power networks\n\nincreases grid complexity. Holistic asset transparency to increase efficiency of existing grid assets and performance, enabled by digitalization, is becoming increasingly important. Digitalization involves increased product and system connectivity and provid- ing intelligent solutions for the management of complex energy networks. Connected assets provide value potential for additional services and enhanced asset operation. The continuously grow- ing demand for electricity worldwide requires stable transporta- tion of greener bulk power with minimal losses from the location of generation to different demand load centers, some of which may even be located in other countries.\n\nR & D activities of the power generation and oil and gas busi- nesses concentrate on developing products and solutions for enhancing efficiency and flexibility, and for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in power generation and in the oil and gas indus- try. These products and solutions include turbomachinery – primarily high-performance, low-emission gas turbines for sim- ple-cycle operation or for combined-cycle power plants – and compressor solutions combining electrical, automation, and digitalization offerings for oil and gas as well as process indus- tries. A field of activity is using hydrogen as a renewable fuel in gas turbines. Gas and Power is also intensifying R & D in innova- tive materials, advanced manufacturing methods and plant opti- mization. In the transmission business, R & D activities focus on preparing the portfolio for a deregulated environment in which total cost of ownership is decisive. Innovations accordingly focus on product digitalization, power electronics, software-driven power control, environmentally friendly products and systems, and grid stabilization. The increasing infeed of renewable energy to power grids, with distributed generation on the rise, requires those grids to become more flexible and efficient. The invest- ments of Gas and Power are focused on enhancing productivity through automation and increasing customer proximity via stra- tegic localization of capacity. Investing activities mainly relate to gas turbines and turbine components.\n\nFiscal year\n\n% Change\n\n(in millions of €)\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nActual\n\nComp.\n\nOrders\n\n19,975\n\n18,451\n\n8 %\n\n7 %\n\nRevenue\n\n17,663\n\n18,125\n\n(3) %\n\n(4) %\n\ntherein: service business\n\n8,025\n\n7,756\n\n3 %\n\n2 %\n\nAdjusted EBITA\n\n679\n\n722\n\n(6) %\n\nAdjusted EBITA margin\n\n3.8 %\n\n4.0 %\n\nOrders were up clearly year-over-year, due mainly to higher orders in the new-unit business.

            "Table of Contents\n\nAs at December 31, 2019, the Company held $133 million of U.S. Treasury Bonds, all transferred to a financial institution with high credit quality. These transactions were concluded in compliance with the Company’s policy to optimize the return on its short-term interest rate investments, always placed with institutions with high credit rating. The Company, acting as the securities lender, does not hold any collateral on the unsecured securities lending transactions. The Company retains effective control on the transferred securities. U.S. Treasury Bonds totaling $200 million matured in 2019. The amount was reported as proceeds from matured marketable securities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the period ended December 31, 2019.\n\nThe debt securities had an average rating of Aaa/AA+/AAA from Moody’s, S&P and Fitch, respectively, with a weighted average maturity of 1.5 years. The debt securities were reported as current assets on the line “Marketable Securities” on the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2019, since they represented investments of funds available for current operations. The bonds were classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value as at December 31, 2019. This fair value measurement corresponds to a Level 1 fair value hierarchy measurement. The aggregate amortized cost basis of these securities totaled $132 million as at December 31, 2019.\n\n4.

In periods where the Company estimates that the cost to grow live birds in inventory to a marketable age and then process and distribute those birds will be lower in the aggregate than the anticipated sales proceeds, the Company values the broiler inventories on hand at cost and accumulates costs as the birds are grown to a marketable age subsequent to the balance sheet date. In periods where the Company estimates that the cost to grow live birds in inventory to a marketable age and then process and distribute those birds will be higher in the aggregate than the anticipated sales proceeds, the Company will make an adjustment to lower the value of live birds in inventory to the net realizable value. The significant judgments that management makes in order to assess the net realizable value of its broiler inventory include estimating future selling prices of finished products and the related cost of sales to complete. The Company recorded a charge of $2.8 million at October 31, 2019 and of $9.6 million at October 31, 2018 to reduce the values of live broiler inventories on hand at those dates from cost to net realizable value.\n\nThe increases in feed, eggs and other, processed poultry and packaging materials inventories are also attributable to an increase in the inventory volume at the Tyler, Texas facility.\n\nThe increase in prepared chicken inventory is attributable to the mix of the different finished products in inventory at October 31, 2019, as compared to October 31, 2018, as well as an increase in production volume at the Company's prepared chicken facility in Flowood, Mississippi. During fiscal 2019, the facility processed approximately 129.1 million pounds of prepared chicken products, as compared to approximately 107.6 million pounds during fiscal 2018. Approximately 1.2 million pounds of that increase was in inventory at October 31, 2019, representing an approximately 12% increase in inventory volume.\n\n"

Our sales to Huawei were included in our MBU, CNBU, SBU, and EBU segments and our sales to Kingston were included in our CNBU, MBU, and SBU segments.\n\nWe generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and production equipment; however, only a limited\n\nnumber of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and production equipment that meet our standards and, in some cases, materials or production equipment are provided by a single supplier.\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, money market\n\naccounts, certificates of deposit, fixed-rate debt securities, trade receivables, share repurchase, capped call, and derivative contracts. We invest through high-credit-quality financial institutions and, by policy, generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting investments with any single obligor and monitoring credit risk of bank counterparties on an ongoing basis. A concentration of credit risk may exist with respect to receivables of certain customers. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of customers worldwide and generally do not require collateral from our customers. Historically, we have not experienced material losses on receivables. A concentration of risk may also exist with respect to our foreign currency hedges as the number of counterparties to our hedges is limited and the notional amounts are relatively large. We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions and through entering into master netting arrangements. Capped call agreements expose us to credit risk to the extent the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions and by spreading the risk across several major financial institutions. In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.\n\nGeographic Information\n\nRevenue based on the geographic location of our customer's headquarters was as follows:\n\nFor the year ended United States Mainland China (excluding Hong Kong) Taiwan Hong Kong Other Asia Pacific Japan Other\n\n$\n\n2019\n\n12,451 3,595 2,703 1,614 1,032 958 1,053 23,406\n\n$\n\n2018\n\n17,116 3,607 3,918 1,761 1,458 1,265 1,266 30,391\n\n$\n\n$\n\n$\n\n$\n\nWe ship our products to locations specified by our customers and, as a result, customers may have headquarters in one location with global supply chain and operations in other locations.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTThe Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is determined based upon the exit price that would be received to sellan asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, as determined by either the principal market or the most advantageousmarket. Inputs used in the valuation techniques to derive fair values are classified based on a three-level hierarchy, as follows:Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2—Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets with insufficient volumeor infrequent transactions (less active markets), or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from orcorroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3—Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities.The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company’sinvestments are in money market funds, U.S. treasury bonds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, asset-backed securities and corporate debt securities, whichare classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, and were initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued at each reporting date utilizingmarket-observable data.

Upon adoption of the standard effective January 1, 2019, the Company recognized an operating lease right-of-use assets of approximately $13.4 million and a corresponding operating lease liability of approximately $16.0 million, which included reclassifying existing deferred rent liability of $2.6 million to operating lease right-of-use assets.\n\nNote 2: Net Income Per Share\n\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per share is\n\ncomputed by adjusting the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares included in the diluted calculation consist of incremental shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options calculated using the treasury stock method.\n\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nNet income\n\n$\n\n4,155 $\n\n4,661\n\nWeighted average common shares—basic\n\n11,809\n\n12,323\n\nEffect of dilutive securities: stock options\n\n226\n\n187\n\nWeighted average common shares—diluted\n\n12,035\n\n12,510\n\nNet income per share—basic\n\n$\n\n0.35 $\n\n0.38\n\nNet income per share—diluted\n\n$\n\n0.35 $\n\n0.37\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, options to purchase 200,000 and 200,000 shares of common stock, respectively, were not included in the\n\ncomputation of diluted net income per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.\n\nNote 3: Balance Sheet Components\n\nPrepaid expenses and other consist of the following (in thousands):\n\nDecember 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nPrepaid expenses\n\n$\n\n2,303 $\n\nOther current assets\n\n193\n\nTotal prepaid expenses and other\n\n$\n\n2,496 $\n\n63\n\n1,780\n\n167\n\n1,947"

            "The Company’s software license arrangements with its customers often include multiple promises to transfer licensed software products and services. Determining whether the products and/or services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment.\n\nThe Company’s SaaS and PaaS arrangements may include variable consideration in the form of usage-based fees. If the arrangement that includes variable consideration in the form of usage-based fees does not meet the allocation exception for variable consideration, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration at the outset of the arrangement using either the expected value or most likely amount method, depending on the specifics of each arrangement. These estimates are constrained to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of incremental revenue will not occur and are updated each reporting period as additional information becomes available.\n\nJudgment is used in determining: (1) whether the financing component in a software license agreement is significant and, if so, (2) the discount rate used in calculating the significant financing component. The Company assesses the significance of the financing component based on the ratio of license fees paid over time to total license fees. If determined to be significant, the financing component is calculated using a rate that discounts the license fees to the cash selling price.\n\nJudgment is also used in assessing whether the extension of payment terms in a software license arrangement results in variable consideration and, if so, the amount to be included in the transaction price. The Company applies the portfolio approach to estimating the amount of variable consideration in these arrangements using the most likely amount method that is based on the Company’s historical collection experience under similar arrangements.\n\nSignificant judgment is required to determine the SSP for each performance obligation, the amount allocated to each performance obligation and whether it depicts the amount that the Company expects to receive in exchange for the related product and/or service. As the selling prices of the Company’s software licenses are highly variable, the Company estimates SSP of its software licenses using the residual approach when the software license is sold with other services and observable SSPs exist for the other services. The Company uses a range of amounts to estimate SSP for maintenance and services. These ranges are based on stand-alone sales and vary based on the type of service and geographic region. If the SSP of a performance obligation is not directly observable, the Company will maximize observable inputs to determine its SSP.\n\nContract Balances\n\nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. The Company records an accrued receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing and the Company’s right to consideration only requires the passage of time, or deferred revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing.\n\nTotal receivables represent amounts billed and amounts earned that are to be billed in the future (i.e., accrued receivables). Included in accrued receivables are services and SaaS and PaaS revenues earned in the current period but billed in the following period and amounts due under multi-year software license arrangements with extended payment terms for which the Company has an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment subsequent to invoicing.\n\nTotal receivables, net is comprised of the following (in thousands):\n\nDecember 31,\n\nBilled receivables Allowance for doubtful accounts\n\nBilled receivables, net\n\nAccrued receivables Significant financing component\n\nTotal accrued receivables, net Less: current accrued receivables Less: current significant financing component\n\nTotal long-term accrued receivables, net\n\n$\n\n2019 213,654 $ (5,149 ) 208,505 399,302 (35,569 ) 363,733 161,714 (11,022 ) 213,041 572,238 $\n\n2018 239,275 (3,912 ) 235,363 336,858 (35,029 ) 301,829 123,053 (10,234 ) 189,010 537,192\n\nTotal receivables, net\n\n$\n\nNo customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated receivables balance as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\n",

Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, consisting of net loss of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $26.2 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $16.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $10.0 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an outflow from the changes in accrued liabilities and other of $5.9 million and inventory of $5.6 million, partially offset by an inflow from changes in deferred revenue of $3.2 million.\n\nThe unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and other was driven by an increase in lease liabilities associated with the lease of the San Jose corporate office. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to build up of inventory and timing of shipments, partially offset by increased reserves. The favorable change in deferred revenues was primarily driven by increased bookings.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million, consisting of net loss of $27.6 million which includes payments for our internal investigation costs of $8.6 million, non-cash charges of $25.0 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.9 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $3.1 million, offset primarily by an outflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $6.1 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and inventory of $1.5 million.\n\nThe favorable change in deferred revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the sale of subscription and support. The favorable change in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, increased value added tax accrual due to timing of payments, and an increase in legal fees accrual. The unfavorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections. The unfavorable change in prepaid and other assets was mainly driven by the increase in deferred sales commissions due to higher deferred revenue and higher average commission rate. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to the timing of shipments.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $14.3 million, consisting of a net loss of $10.8 million, a cash decrease resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million and non-cash charges of $26.4 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $17.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance of $1.1 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $12.4 million and deferred revenue of $3.0 million, and an outflow from the change in accrued liabilities of $8.9 million, inventory of $4.7 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and accounts payable of $0.9 million.\n\n",

ASU 2019-12 is intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes by, among other things, eliminating certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod taxallocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences.ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, the Company must apply certainaspects of this standard retrospectively for all periods presented while other aspects are applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effectadjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on itsconsolidated financial statements.In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments(“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 is intended to provide more decision-useful information about expected credit losses on financial instruments and othercommitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The main provisions include presenting financial assets measured at amortized costat the amount expected to be collected, which is net of an allowance for expected credit losses, and recording credit losses related to available-for-sale securitiesthrough an allowance for credit losses. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and must be appliedusing a modified retrospective approach with earlier adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company does not expect theadoption of this amendment to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.4. REVENUEThe Company adopted ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. The Company recognized the cumulative effect ofinitially applying ASC 606, which was immaterial, as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative prior period information isaccounted for in accordance with the previous revenue guidance, ASC 605, and has not been restated. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company recognizesrevenue under the core principle to depict the transfer of control to the Company’s customers in an amount reflecting the consideration the Company expects to beentitled. In order to achieve that core principle, the Company applies the following five step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify theperformance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5)recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.Revenue for product sales is recognized at the point in time when control transfers to the Company’s customers, which is generally when products areshipped from the Company’s manufacturing facilities or when delivered to the customer’s named location. When the Company performs shipping and handlingactivities after the transfer of control to the customer (e.g., when control transfers prior to delivery), they are considered to be fulfillment activities, andaccordingly, the costs are accrued for when the related revenue is recognized. Taxes collected on behalf of customers relating to product sales and remitted togovernmental authorities, principally sales taxes, are excluded from revenue."

In conjunction with the changes to reporting units, we reassigned goodwill between CGD and CMS based on their relative fair values on October 1, 2017.\n\nIn July 2017, we acquired Deltenna, a wireless infrastructure company specializing in the design and delivery of radio and antenna communication solutions. Deltenna’s operations were included in our CGD reporting unit upon its acquisition. On April 1, 2019, we reorganized our reporting structure to include Deltenna in our CMS reporting unit and reassigned $3.4 million of goodwill from CGD to CMS based upon its relative fair value. Since its acquisition, Deltenna’s sales, operating results, and cash flows have not been significant to our consolidated results. As such, reportable segment information has not been restated for this change in the composition of our reportable segments.\n\nWe complete our annual goodwill impairment test each year as of July 1 separately for our CTS, CGD and CMS reporting units.\n\nThe test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process. The first step of the test is performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including recorded goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment, if any, by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount. Any resulting impairment determined would be recorded in the current period.\n\nFor our 2019 impairment test, the estimated fair value of all three of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts. As such, there was no impairment of goodwill in 2019.\n\nSignificant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that are used in our impairment analysis. The estimates we used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business. Although we believe our underlying assumptions supporting these assessments are reasonable, if our forecasted sales and margin growth rates, timing of growth, or the discount rate vary from our forecasts, we may be required to perform interim analyses in fiscal 2020 that could expose us to material impairment charges in the future.\n\n107\n\nTotal\n\n",

SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\nThe Company designs, develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of products, including discrete and standard commodity components, application-specific integrated circuits (“ASICs”), full custom devices and semi-custom devices and application-specific standard products (“ASSPs”) for analog, digital, and mixed-signal applications. In addition, the Company further participates in the manufacturing value chain of Smartcard products, which includes the production and sale of both silicon chips and Smartcards.\n\nThe Company’s reportable segments are as follows:\n\n\n\nAutomotive and Discrete Group (ADG), comprised of dedicated automotive ICs (both digital and analog), and discrete and power transistor products for all market segments.\n\n\n\nAnalog, MEMS and Sensors Group (AMS), comprised of low-power high-end analog ICs (both custom and general purpose) for all markets, smart power products for Industrial, Computer and personal electronics markets, Touch Screen Controllers, Low Power Connectivity solutions (both wireline and wireless) for IoT, power conversion products, metering solutions for Smart Grid, specialized imaging sensors and modules, and all MEMS products for sensors or Actuators.\n\nMicrocontrollers and Digital ICs Group (MDG), comprised of general purpose and secure microcontrollers, EEPROM memories, Digital ASICs, Aerospace & Defense products including components for microwave and millimeter wave.\n\n",

Maintenance and repair costs are\n\nexpensed as incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method using estimated useful lives of 5 to 40 years for buildings and building improvements and 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment. A summary of property, plant and equipment is shown below:\n\n(Dollars in Millions)\n\nApril 27, 2019\n\nLand\n\n$\n\n3.7\n\n$\n\nBuildings and Building Improvements\n\n81.2\n\nMachinery and Equipment\n\n390.7\n\nTotal Property, Plant and Equipment, Gross\n\n475.6\n\nLess: Accumulated Depreciation\n\n283.7\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\n\n$\n\n191.9\n\n$\n\nDepreciation expense was $27.2 million, $22.5 million and $22.0 million in fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. As of April 27, 2019 and April 28, 2018, capital expenditures recorded in accounts payable totaled $6.4 million and $9.0 million, respectively.\n\nIncome Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting\n\nand tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“U.S. Tax Reform”) includes a new global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”)\n\nprovision which requires the Company to include foreign subsidiary earnings in its U.S. tax return starting in fiscal 2019. The FASB Staff Q&A, Topic 740 No. 5, \"Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income,\" states that an entity can make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse in future years or provide for the tax expense in the year the tax is incurred. The Company has elected to recognize the tax on GILTI as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred and therefore has not included any deferred tax impacts of GILTI in its consolidated financial statements for its fiscal year ended April 27, 2019.\n\nRevenue Recognition. On April 29, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606,\n\n“Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” using the modified retrospective transition method. Under the new standard, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard was recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. In accordance with the modified retrospective transition method, the historical information within the financial statements has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standard in effect for those periods. As a result, the Company has disclosed the accounting policies in effect prior to April 29, 2018, as well as the policies it has applied starting April 29, 2018. See Note 2, \"Revenue,\" for further details.\n\nPeriods prior to April 29, 2018\n\nRevenue was recognized in accordance with ASC 605, \"Revenue Recognition.\" Revenue was recognized upon either\n\nshipment or delivery (depending on shipping terms) of product to customers and is recorded net of returns, allowances, customer discounts, and incentives. Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities were accounted for on a net (excluded from revenues) basis.\n\nPeriods commencing on or after April 29, 2018\n\nThe majority of the Company's revenue is recognized at a point in time. The Company has determined that the most\n\ndefinitive demonstration that control has transferred to a customer is physical shipment or delivery, depending on the contractual shipping terms, with the exception of consignment transactions. Consignment transactions are arrangements where the Company transfers product to a customer location but retains ownership and control of such product until it is used by the customer. Revenue for consignment arrangements is recognized upon the customer’s usage.\n\nF-10\n\nApril 28, 2018\n\n0.8\n\n69.2\n\n364.7\n\n434.7\n\n272.5\n\n162.",

            "Foreign Currency Translation and Transaction Gains and Losses The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the applicable local currency, the Swedish Krona, the Japanese Yen, the South Korean Won and theTaiwan Dollar. The translation from Swedish Krona, Japanese Yen, South Korean Won or the Taiwan Dollar to U.S. Dollars is performed for balance sheetaccounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for income statement accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during theperiod. Gains or (losses) resulting from translation are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or (losses)resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations andwere $105,000 and $(58,000) during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Foreign currency translation (losses) were $(183,000) and$(357,000) during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net Loss per Share Net loss per share amounts have been computed based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the years endedDecember 31, 2019 and 2018. All shares of common stock and potential common stock equivalents in the calculations used to determine weighted average number of shares of commonstock outstanding have been adjusted to reflect the effects of the reverse stock split for all periods presented. Net loss per share, assuming dilution amounts fromcommon stock equivalents, is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and potential common stock equivalents outstandingduring the period. The weighted-average number of shares of common stock and potential common stock equivalents used in computing the net loss per share foryears ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 exclude the potential common stock equivalents, as the effect would be anti-dilutive. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Our other comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign currency translation gains and losses. The cumulative amount of translation gains and losses arereflected as a separate component of stockholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheets as accumulated other comprehensive loss. Cash Flow Information Cash flows in foreign currencies have been converted to U.S. Dollars at an approximate weighted-average exchange rate for the respective reportingperiods.

In constant currency, our total applications revenues and our total infrastructure revenues each grew during fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 as customers continued to deploy our applications technologies and infrastructure technologies through different deployment models that we offer that enable customer choice.

In periods where the Company estimates that the cost to grow live birds in inventory to a marketable age and then process and distribute those birds will be lower in the aggregate than the anticipated sales proceeds, the Company values the broiler inventories on hand at cost and accumulates costs as the birds are grown to a marketable age subsequent to the balance sheet date. In periods where the Company estimates that the cost to grow live birds in inventory to a marketable age and then process and distribute those birds will be higher in the aggregate than the anticipated sales proceeds, the Company will make an adjustment to lower the value of live birds in inventory to the net realizable value. The significant judgments that management makes in order to assess the net realizable value of its broiler inventory include estimating future selling prices of finished products and the related cost of sales to complete. The Company recorded a charge of $2.8 million at October 31, 2019 and of $9.6 million at October 31, 2018 to reduce the values of live broiler inventories on hand at those dates from cost to net realizable value.\n\nThe increases in feed, eggs and other, processed poultry and packaging materials inventories are also attributable to an increase in the inventory volume at the Tyler, Texas facility.\n\nThe increase in prepared chicken inventory is attributable to the mix of the different finished products in inventory at October 31, 2019, as compared to October 31, 2018, as well as an increase in production volume at the Company's prepared chicken facility in Flowood, Mississippi. During fiscal 2019, the facility processed approximately 129.1 million pounds of prepared chicken products, as compared to approximately 107.6 million pounds during fiscal 2018. Approximately 1.2 million pounds of that increase was in inventory at October 31, 2019, representing an approximately 12% increase in inventory volume.\n\n",

            "137 Vodafone Group Plc\n\nAnnual Report 2019\n\n6. Taxation\n\nThis note explains how our Group tax charge arises. The deferred tax section of the note also provides information on our expected future tax charges and sets out the tax assets held across the Group together with our view on whether or not we expect to be able to make use of these in the future.\n\nAccounting policies Income tax expense represents the sum of the current and deferred taxes.\n\nCurrent tax payable or recoverable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because some items of income or expense are taxable or deductible in different years or may never be taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.\n\nThe Group recognises provisions for uncertain tax positions when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and management judge that it is probable that there will be a future outflow of economic benefits from the Group to settle the obligation. Uncertain tax positions are assessed and measured on an issue by issue basis within the jurisdictions that we operate using management’s estimate of the most likely outcome. The Group recognises interest on late paid taxes as part of financing costs, and any penalties, if applicable, as part of the income tax expense.\n\nDeferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in the future arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. It is accounted for using the statement of financial position liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that temporary differences or taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.\n\nSuch assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised to the extent they arise from the initial recognition of non-tax deductible goodwill.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint arrangements, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting period date and adjusted to reflect changes in the Group’s assessment that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.\n\nTax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they either relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities which intend to settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\n\nTax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the tax is recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity.\n\nIncome tax expense\n\n2019 €m\n\n2018 €m\n\nUnited Kingdom corporation tax expense/(credit):\n\nCurrent year1 Adjustments in respect of prior years\n\n21 (9) 12\n\n70 (5) 65\n\nOverseas current tax expense/(credit):\n\nCurrent year Adjustments in respect of prior years\n\nTotal current tax expense\n\n1,098 (48) 1,050 1,062\n\n1,055 (102) 953 1,018\n\nDeferred tax on origination and reversal of temporary differences:\n\nUnited Kingdom deferred tax Overseas deferred tax\n\nTotal deferred tax expense/(credit) Total income tax expense/(credit)\n\n(232) 666 434 1,496\n\n39 (1,936) (1,897) (879)\n\nNote: 1 The income statement tax charge includes tax relief on capitalised interest.\n\nUK operating profits are more than offset by statutory allowances for capital investment in the UK network and systems plus ongoing interest costs including those arising from the €10.3 billion of spectrum payments to the UK government in 2000 and 2013.\n\n2017 €m\n\n27 (3) 24\n\n961 (35) 926 950\n\n"

In addition, ESPP provides for annual increases in the number of shares available for issuance on the first day of each year equal to the least of (i) 0.5% of the outstanding shares of common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding year, (ii) 400,000 shares or (iii) such other amount as may be determined by the Board of Directors. Eligible employees can enroll and elect to contribute up to 15% of their base compensation through payroll withholdings in each offering period, subject to certain limitations.

During 2018, professional fees included amounts relating to the tax treatment dispute relating to the lease of three LNG carriers (or the RasGas II LNG Carriers) in Teekay LNG's 70%-owned consolidated subsidiary Teekay Nakilat Corporation (or the RasGas II Joint Venture) and claims against a Norway-based marine transportation company, I.M. Skaugen SE, for damages and losses for Teekay LNG's seven multi-gas carriers previously on charter to them; and\n\n\n\nan increase of $3.2 million due to the Polar Spirit being off-hire for 35 days in 2018 primarily due to an incident investigation involving a collision with a small vessel and repositioning to other charters;\n\npartially offset by\n\n\n\na decrease of $9.1 million due to the Madrid Spirit and Galicia Spirit being off-hire for 82 days and 38 days in 2019, respectively, and the impact of the depreciation of the Euro on Teekay LNG's Euro-denominated revenue and Euro-denominated operating expenses, partially offset by the Catalunya Spirit being off-hire for 28 days in 2018 for a scheduled dry docking; and\n\n\n\na decrease of $3.5 million due to decrease in operating expenses passed through to the charterer and due to declining revenue recognition for charter contracts accounted for as direct financing leases for the Tangguh Sago and Tangguh Hiri in 2019.\n\n",
            "\n\nThe duration of some of our FPSO contracts is the life of the relevant oil field or is subject to extension by the field operator or vessel charterer. If the oil field no longer produces oil or is abandoned or the contract term is not extended, we will no longer generate revenue under the related contract and will need to seek to redeploy affected vessels. FPSO contracts under which our FPSO units operate are subject to extensions beyond their initial term. The likelihood of these contracts being extended may be negatively affected by reductions in oil field reserves, low oil prices generally or other factors. If we are unable to promptly redeploy any affected vessels at rates at least equal to those under the contracts, if at all, our operating results will be harmed. Any potential redeployment may not be under long-term contracts, which may affect the stability of our cash flow and our ability to make cash distributions. FPSO units, in particular, are specialized vessels that have very limited alternative uses and high fixed costs. In addition, FPSO units typically require substantial capital investments prior to being redeployed to a new field and production service agreement. Any idle time prior to the commencement of a new contract or our inability to redeploy the vessels at acceptable rates may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\n\nWe do not control access to cash flow generated by our investments in equity-accounted joint ventures. We do not have control over the operations of, nor do we have any legal claim to the revenue and expenses of our investments in, our equity-accounted joint ventures. Consequently, the cash flow generated by our investments in equity-accounted joint ventures may not be available for use by us in the period that such cash flows are generated.\n\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe results of operations that follow have first been divided into (a) our controlling interests in our publicly-traded subsidiaries Teekay LNG and Teekay Tankers and (b) Teekay Parent. Within these groups, we have further subdivided the results into their respective lines of business.

Net voyage revenues divided by the number of days on the charter provides theTime Charter Equivalent (TCE) Rate. Net voyage revenues and TCE rates are widely used by investors and analysts in the tanker shipping industry for comparing the financialperformance of companies and for preparing industry averages. We believe that our method of calculating net voyage revenue is consistent with industry standards. The table belowreconciles our net voyage revenues to voyage revenues. Years Ended December 31, All figures in USD ‘000, except TCE rate per day 2019 2018 Variance Voyage Revenue 317,220 289,016 9.8%Less Voyage expenses (141,770) (165,012) (14.1%)Net Voyage Revenue 175,450 124,004 41.5%Vessel Calendar Days (1) 8,395 9,747 (13.9%)Less off-hire days 293 277 5.8%Total TCE days 8,102 9,470 (14.4%)TCE Rate per day (2) $21,655 $13,095 65.4%)Total Days for vessel operating expenses 8,395 9,747 (13.9%)(1)Vessel Calendar Days is the total number of days the vessels were in our fleet.(2)Time Charter Equivalent (“TCE”) Rate, results from Net Voyage Revenue divided by total TCE days.The change in Voyage revenue is due to two main factors:i)The number of TCE daysii)The change in the TCE rate achieved.With regards to i), the decrease in vessel calendar days is mainly due to the disposal of ten vessels in 2018, offset by three 2018 Newbuildings delivered in the latter part of 2018.43\n\nWith regards to ii), the TCE rate increased by $8,560, or 65.4%. The indicative rates presented by Clarksons Shipping increased by 91.7% for the twelve months of 2019compared to the same twelve months in 2018 to $31,560 from $16,466, respectively. The rates presented by Clarksons Shipping were significantly influenced by the spike in the Suezmaxtanker rates in the fourth quarter of both 2019 and 2018. Our average TCE was also positively impacted by the increased tanker rates towards the end of 2019, but not to the same extentas the rates reported by Clarksons Shipping. We expect this spike to materialize to a larger extent in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the rates reported by Clarksons Shipping.As a result of i) and ii) net voyage revenues increased by 41.5% from $124.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to $175.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.Voyage expenses decreased to $141.8 million from $165.0 million, or 14.1%. The decrease in voyage expenses was primarily due to a decrease in vessel calendar days asdiscussed above.Vessel operating expenses decreased by $14.4 million, or 17.9%, from $80.4 million in 2018 to $66.0 million in 2019. This was primarily due to the decrease in our fleet as discussedabove. In cooperation with our technical managers we maintain our focus on keeping the fleet in top technical condition whilst keeping costs low.No impairment loss on vessels has been recorded in 2019 compared to a loss of $2.2 million recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018.General and administrative expenses increased $0.7 million, or 5.9%, from $12.7 million in 2018 to $13.5 million in 2019.Depreciation expenses increased by $3.3 million, or 5.4%, from $60.7 million in 2018 to $64.0 million in 2019. The increase is primarily due to the full-year effect of the threevessels added to the fleet in the latter part of 2018.Interest expenses increased by $3.8 million, or 11.1%, from $34.5 million in 2018 to $38.4 million in 2019. The increase is mainly due to the full year-effect of the loans associatedwith the three vessels added to the fleet in latter part of 2018 and a non-cash expense of about $1.7 million related to the remaining borrowing cost under the Credit Facility that wasrepaid on February 12, 2019.Other financial expenses decreased by $10.6, or 71.4%, from $14.8 million in 2018 to $4.2 million in 2019 mainly due an expense related to fair value change of $3.2 million forInvestment Securities, offset by the cancellation of the Backstop facility in 2018 and expense of the associated fees of $13.4 million.Please see Item 5.

            "We measure and report our annual scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions. As part of our commitment to reduce our Greenhouse Gas (‘GHG’) emissions, we moved to a certified green tariff renewable electricity supply contract for our UK operations from the beginning of the financial year.\n\nThe GHG emissions summary below shows our gross emissions including location-based scope 2 emissions, as well as our net emissions accounting for the market-based scope 2 reporting for our certified green electricity tariff.\n\nThe reduction in emissions is driven by continued progress in energy efficiency, a reduction in emissions associated with refrigerants as we continue to move away from fluorinated gas refrigerants, and the general reduction in UK grid carbon factor as more renewables make up a greater proportion of the fuel mix.\n\nReducing packaging and plastics Packaging and plastic have played a vital role in safe food storage and distribution for decades, but now our approach to their use is changing. We work with our customers to look for the best packaging solutions for all our products, that take into account the environmental impact, while keeping our food fresher for longer. We are committed to working with our customers to reducing our use of single-use plastics and partnering with suppliers to find effective alternatives.\n\nWe support the UK Plastics Pact and are committed to meeting its 2025 targets. We will monitor and reduce the amount of plastics used to transport and consume our products, and we aim to develop a circular system whereby plastic is used less and kept out of the environment. Throughout FY19, we have engaged with all key customers and have plans to remove remaining ‘hard to recycle’ packaging as soon as possible.\n\nOver the last six years, we have made good progress in our water consumption per tonne of product, reducing it by 15% over the period. There was also a significant improvement in FY19, and one of the contributing factors to the improvement was the closure of the Evercreech desserts facility which had a higher water intensity than most sites within the business.\n\nWater consumption per tonne of product – UK manufacturing (m3 per tonne)\n\nIn FY19, we saved 18.7 tonnes of plastic by replacing the black plastic trays in a ready meal range with foil. Activities targeting relatively small pieces of plastic such as ‘windows’ on quiche boxes have also led to significant reductions in plastic use.\n\nWe have recycled 758 tonnes of plastic from our manufacturing and distribution activities in FY19 and have identified opportunities for further improvements in the future.\n\nFY19\n\n5.91\n\nFY18\n\n6.45\n\nPrimary energy consumption per tonne of product – UK manufacturing (kWhp per tonne)\n\nFY19\n\n1,235\n\nFY18\n\n1,299\n\nEmissions are summarised below, all reported as CO2 equivalent (‘CO2e’) Emissions from:\n\nEmissions reported in tonnes CO2e* FY19**\n\nFY18**\n\nFY18***\n\nCombustion of fuel and operation of facilities (Scope 1)\n\n59,495\n\n66,336\n\n75,600\n\nElectricity, heat, steam and cooling purchased for own use (Scope 2)\n\n27,633\n\n32,389\n\n67,754\n\nTotal gross emissions (Scope 1 and 2)\n\n87,128\n\n98,725\n\n143,354\n\nGreen tariff\n\n27,603\n\n0\n\n0\n\nTotal net emissions (Scope 1 and 2)\n\n59,525\n\n98,725\n\n143,354\n\nRatio (KgCO2e per £1 sales revenue)\n\n0.060\n\n0.066\n\n0.056\n\nOur GHG emissions have been calculated using the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, and emissions factors from DEFRA’s\n\nUK government GHG conversion factors for company reporting (where factors have not been provided directly by a supplier).\n\n** UK & Ireland only – comparable with FY19 Group structure. *** Full Group including US business.\n\nAnnual Report and Financial Statements 2019\n\n",
            "STEM initiatives and community impact projects Spirent actively encourages its employees to become STEM Ambassadors around the globe. We expanded our STEM programme in 2019 and our STEM Ambassadors work with students in local schools and institutions to help them develop STEM skills and start out in their professional journey. We now have STEM Ambassadors in APAC, EMEA and the Americas.\n\nEmissions from:\n\nCombustion of fuel and operation of facilities (Scope 1)\n\nElectricity, heat, steam and cooling purchased for own use (Scope 2)\n\nTotal emissions\n\n2019 Tonnes of CO2e\n\n144.7\n\n4,641.0\n\n4,785.7\n\n2018 Tonnes of CO2e\n\n137.2\n\n4,950.4\n\n5,087.6\n\nEmissions intensity metrics:\n\nWe also provide our employees in the US and EMEA with volunteering time off to make a positive contribution to the communities in which they work.\n\nNormalised per FTE employee\n\nNormalised per square metre of gross internal area of our facilities\n\nNormalised per $ million of revenues\n\n3.46\n\n0.114\n\n9.50\n\n3.57\n\n0.125\n\n10.67\n\nThrough financial donations and volunteering, Spirent has continued to support community projects worldwide. In 2019 our staff completed more than 710 hours of volunteering and donated in excess of $31,000 to good causes.\n\nProperty Energy use Spirent’s energy use decreased by 2.3 per cent in 2019 to 14,187MWh. This has been primarily driven by our efficiency initiatives delivering strong energy reductions in North America and APAC. There was an increase in energy use in EMEA, driven by the opening of new sites in the UK and Finland, and an increase in energy use at our site in Paris. Gas use also increased in the year by 7 per cent, with all sites seeing similar increases over 2018.\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions Spirent is committed to acting to combat climate change and reporting its progress. Our total Scope 1 and 2 emissions dropped by 6.14 per cent from 2018, and our emissions per $ million of revenue were down by 10.9 per cent. We have reduced our total emissions by 29 per cent since our 2014 baseline.\n\nThe Group responded to the Carbon Disclosure Project in 2019, completing the Climate Change and Supply Chain questionnaires. In 2019 we achieved a Climate Change rating of B (management) (2018 C) and a Supplier Engagement rating of B (management) (2018 B). The average for our sector is C in both categories.\n\nMethodology Reporting on emission sources is required under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors Report) Regulations 2013 and these sources fall within our consolidated financial statements. We have reported on all the emission sources that fall within our consolidated financial statements. We do not have any responsibility for any emission sources that are not included in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe have used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition), along with data gathered to fulfil our requirements under these Regulations, and the most recent emission factors available: UK Government’s GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2019 for the UK, US EPA 2018 eGrid emissions factors for the applicable individual states in the US, and 2018 emissions factors for all other countries were sourced from the International Energy Agency’s 2019 data set.\n\nPerformance against target The Group set a target to reduce carbon emissions by five per cent relative to revenue from 2018 figures. We have achieved this target, having reduced carbon emissions per $million of revenue by 10.9 per cent.\n\nCompliance The Group is not required to comply with stages 1 or 2 of the UK Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (ESOS) Regulations 2014.\n\nProcurement Vendor assessment and auditing Vendors are required to abide by our Code of Conduct which sets out our expectations for environmental management, labour and human rights, health and safety, and business ethics. They are assessed using a detailed questionnaire.\n\nIn addition, priority suppliers are audited by Spirent’s procurement team: 22 supplier audits were conducted in 2019, representing 88.7 per cent of our hardware supply chain spend. This exceeded our target of completing 18 audits in the year. No material issues were identified.\n\nCompliance We comply with the requirements of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act 2010. We require slavery and human trafficking to be eradicated from our direct supply chain for the products we sell and monitor suppliers by performing regular evaluation surveys to assure ourselves of each supplier’s commitment in this area.\n\nSpirent’s full statement on Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking can be found on the Company’s website at https://corporate.spirent.com.\n\nSpirent Communications plc Annual Report 2019\n\n",

            "Table of Contents\n\nOn June 7, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner upheld U.S. Treasury Department regulations requiring that related parties in a cost-sharing arrangement share expenses related to stock-based compensation in proportion to the economic activity of the parties. The ruling reversed the prior decision of the U.S. Tax Court. On November 12, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the plaintiff’s request for an en banc rehearing. Based on the appellate court’s ruling, the Company recorded a cumulative income tax expense of $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The plaintiff filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court on February 10, 2020, and the Company will continue to monitor developments in this matter.\n\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets were as follows (in thousands):\n\nDecember 31,\n\n2019\n\nDeferred tax assets:\n\nNet operating losses and credits\n\n$\n\n113,475 $\n\nFixed assets and intangible assets\n\n61,932\n\nAccruals and reserves\n\n75,133\n\nStock-based compensation\n\n8,615\n\nInventory\n\n429\n\nOther\n\n5,287\n\nTotal deferred tax assets\n\n264,871\n\nLess: valuation allowance\n\n(244,581)\n\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance\n\n20,290\n\nDeferred tax liabilities:\n\nAccruals and reserves\n\n(15,525)\n\nOther\n\n(914)\n\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n\n(16,439)\n\nNet deferred tax assets\n\n$\n\n3,851 $\n\nThe Company accounts for deferred taxes under ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”) which involves weighing positive and negative evidence concerning the realizability of the Company’s deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction. The Company evaluated its ability to realize the benefit of its net deferred tax assets and weighed all available positive and negative evidence both objective and subjective in nature. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the weight given to positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. Consideration was given to negative evidence such as: the duration and severity of losses in prior years, high seasonal revenue concentrations, increasing competitive pressures, and a challenging retail environment. Realization of the Company’s net deferred tax assets is dependent upon its generation of sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income change.\n\nThe Company recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the net amount that the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has a valuation allowance of $191.7 million against its U.S. deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance of $52.9 million against certain of its foreign deferred tax assets that the Company is not expected to realize. The Company will continue to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets in each of the applicable jurisdictions going forward.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company has U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $316.2 million which expire beginning after 2032, California net operating loss carryforwards of $57.3 million which expire beginning after 2032, and other states net operating loss carryforwards of $52.1 million which expire beginning after 2023. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has U.S. federal research tax credit carryforwards of approximately $22.6 million, which if not utilized, begin to expire after 2031, California research tax credit carryforwards of approximately $45.0 million, which do not expire, Massachusetts research tax credit carryforwards of approximately $2.9 million, which if not utilized, begin to expire after 2028,\n\n98\n\n2018\n\n61,494\n\n55,476\n\n53,818\n\n9,494\n\n911\n\n4,806\n\n185,999\n\n(181,122)\n\n4,877\n\n—\n\n(560)\n\n(560)\n\n",

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTThe Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is determined based upon the exit price that would be received to sellan asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, as determined by either the principal market or the most advantageousmarket. Inputs used in the valuation techniques to derive fair values are classified based on a three-level hierarchy, as follows:Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2—Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets with insufficient volumeor infrequent transactions (less active markets), or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from orcorroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3—Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities.The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company’sinvestments are in money market funds, U.S. treasury bonds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, asset-backed securities and corporate debt securities, whichare classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, and were initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued at each reporting date utilizingmarket-observable data.

For the years ended 30 June 2019 and 30 June 2018, the Group has valued assets classified as held for sale at the contractually agreed sales price less estimated cost of sale or other observable evidence of market value.\n\nFair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (level 3)\n\nValuation techniques used to determine level 3 fair values and valuation process Investment properties, principally storage buildings, are held for rental to customers requiring self- storage facilities and are carried at fair value.

The independent valuations are performed by an accredited independent valuer. Investment properties are independently valued on a rotational basis every three years unless the underlying financing requires a more frequent valuation cycle. For properties subject to an independent valuation report the Directors verify all major inputs to the valuation and review the results with the independent valuer. The Director valuations are completed by the NSH Group Board. The valuations are determined using the same techniques and similar estimates to those applied by the independent valuer.\n\nThe Group is required to restore the leased premises in a number of leasehold properties to their original condition at the end of lease term. A provision has been recognised for the present value of the estimated expenditure required to remove any leasehold improvements.\n\nThe Group obtains the majority of its external independent valuations at each financial year end. The Group’s policy is to maintain the valuation of the investment property valued in the preceding year at external valuation, unless there is an indication of a significant change to the property’s valuation inputs.\n\n10.8.

These external valuations provide the basis of the Directors’ valuations applied to these properties at 30 June 2019 and 30 June 2018. Including these valuations, 51% of freehold investment properties were subject to external valuations during the year (year ended 30 June 2018: 43% of freehold investment properties).\n\nRecognised fair value measurements\n\nThe Group’s policy is to recognise transfers into and out of fair value hierarchy levels at the end of the reporting period. There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 for recurring fair value measurements during the year. During the year ended 30 June 2019 the Group transferred $2.1m from level 3 to level 2 following the reclassification of assets from freehold investment properties to assets held for sale, and $5.7m from level 2 to level 3 following the reclassification of assets from assets held for sale to freehold investment properties, as detailed in note 10.2.\n\nIn the prior year ended 30 June 2018 the Group transferred $4.4m from level 3 to level 2 following the reclassification of an asset from freehold investment properties to assets held for sale.\n\n96\n\n97\n\n96\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n",
            "Notes to the financial statements continued\n\n17 Joint operations The Group’s interests in Cribbs Causeway and Manchester Arndale are accounted for as joint operations. The Group holds 50 per cent beneficial interests in the relevant freehold or leasehold of these properties. Each joint arrangement is governed by a Trust Deed giving each party rights to income and obligations for expenses in respect of their beneficial interest in the property. The management of the property is established under the Trust Deed as being undertaken by an entity jointly controlled by the beneficial owners of the property. This entity does not have the right to a share of the income or expenditure from the property, other than the receipt of a management fee. Therefore these interests are accounted for as joint operations. The principal place of business of both joint operations is England.\n\n18 Investment in associates\n\n£m\n\n2019\n\nAt 1 January\n\n65.6\n\nShare of post-tax (loss)/profit of associates\n\n(0.3)\n\nImpairment\n\n(7.4)\n\nForeign exchange movements\n\n(4.2)\n\nAt 31 December\n\n53.7\n\nInvestment in associates comprises a 32.4 per cent holding in the ordinary shares of Prozone Intu Properties Limited (Prozone), a listed Indian shopping centre developer, and a 26.8 per cent direct holding in the ordinary shares of Empire Mall Private Limited (Empire) – Empire also forms part of the Prozone group giving the Group an effective ownership of 38.0 per cent. Both companies are incorporated in India.\n\nThe equity method of accounting is applied to the Group’s investments in Prozone and Empire in line with the requirements of IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. The results for the year to 30 September have been used as 31 December information is not available in time for these financial statements. Those results are adjusted to be in line with the Group’s accounting policies and include the most recent property valuations, determined at 30 September 2019, by independent professionally qualified external valuers in line with the valuation methodology described in note 13.\n\nThe market price per share of Prozone at 31 December 2019 was INR19 (31 December 2018: INR29), valuing the Group’s interest at £9.9 million (31 December 2018: £16.4 million) compared with the Prozone carrying value pre-impairment of £41.5 million (31 December 2018: £45.1 million). As the share price of Prozone is lower than its carrying value, a review of the carrying value of Prozone and the Group’s direct interest in Empire (as it also forms part of the Prozone group) has been undertaken. Underpinning the impairment assessment (where the fair value less costs to sell was considered) were the independent third-party valuations received for the investment and development properties, representing the underlying value of the associate’s net assets. Assumptions were also made for tax and other costs that would be reasonably expected if these assets were to be disposed of. Following this review, an impairment of £7.4 million was recognised.\n\n136 136\n\nintu properties plc Annual report 2019 intu properties plc Annual report 2019\n\n2018\n\n64.8\n\n2.3\n\n–\n\n(1.5)\n\n65.",

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n\nLitigation—The Company periodically becomes involved in various claims, lawsuits and proceedings that are incidental to its business. In the opinion of Company management, after consultation with counsel, there are no matters currently pending that would, in the event of an adverse outcome, materially impact the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\n\nVerizon Transaction—In March 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with various operating entities of Verizon Communications Inc. (“Verizon”) that currently provides for the lease, sublease or management of approximately 11,250 wireless communications sites commencing March 27, 2015. The average term of the lease or sublease for all sites at the inception of the agreement was approximately 28 years, assuming renewals or extensions of the underlying ground leases for the sites. The Company has the option to purchase the leased sites in tranches, subject to the applicable lease, sublease or management rights upon its scheduled expiration. Each tower is assigned to an annual tranche, ranging from 2034 to 2047, which represents the outside expiration date for the sublease rights to the towers in that tranche. The purchase price for each tranche is a fixed amount stated in the lease for such tranche plus the fair market value of certain alterations made to the related towers. The aggregate purchase option price for the towers leased and subleased is approximately $5.0 billion. Verizon will occupy the sites as a tenant for an initial term of ten years with eight optional successive five-year terms; each such term shall be governed by standard master lease agreement terms established as a part of the transaction.\n\nAT&T Transaction—The Company has an agreement with SBC Communications Inc., a predecessor entity to AT&T, that currently provides for the lease or sublease of approximately 2,200 towers commencing between December 2000 and August 2004. Substantially all of the towers are part of the Trust Securitizations. The average term of the lease or sublease for all sites at the inception of the agreement was approximately 27 years, assuming renewals or extensions of the underlying ground leases for the sites. The Company has the option to purchase the sites subject to the applicable lease or sublease upon its expiration. Each tower is assigned to an annual tranche, ranging from 2013 to 2032, which represents the outside expiration date for the sublease rights to that tower. The purchase price for each site is a fixed amount stated in the lease for that site plus the fair market value of certain alterations made to the related tower by AT&T.

OTHER OPERATING EXPENSE\n\nOther operating expense consists primarily of impairment charges, net losses on sales or disposals of assets and other operating expense items. The Company records impairment charges to write down certain assets to their net realizable value after an indicator of impairment is identified and subsequent analysis determines that the asset is either partially recoverable or not recoverable. These assets consisted primarily of towers and related assets, which are typically assessed on an individual basis, network location intangibles, which relate directly to towers, and tenant-related intangibles, which are assessed on a tenant basis. Net losses on sales or disposals of assets primarily relate to certain non-core towers, other assets and miscellaneous items.

Interest income increased due to higher interest rates. Other expense in the year ended December 31, 2018, was driven by foreign currency translation losses mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro. Other income in the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven mainly by foreign currency translation gains due to the depreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro.\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nEffective tax rate\n\n19.9%\n\nThe effective income tax rate in 2018 was 19.9% compared to 64.1% in the prior year. The tax rate in 2018 was favorably impacted by a discrete one-time rate change benefit related to the Tax Act resulting from the election of tax accounting method changes, partially offset by a one-time withholding tax on repatriation of earnings from one of our foreign subsidiaries that was completed during the year to enable the use of tax credits due to expire in 2018. The tax rate in 2017 was unfavorably impacted by the application of the Tax Act, driven by the remeasurement of the net deferred tax assets from 35% to 21% and the one-time mandatory transition tax on the historical earnings of foreign affiliates, which resulted in a net non-cash charge of $18,001.\n\nNet earnings were $46,532 or $1.39 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to earnings of $14,448 or $0.43 per diluted share in the comparable period of 2017.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $100,241 at December 31, 2019, and $100,933 at December 31, 2018, of which $98,309 and $96,762, respectively, were held outside the United States. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $692 was primarily driven by cash generated from operating activities of $64,405 and net proceeds from an increase in borrowings of long-term debt of $49,700, which were offset by the payment for the QTI acquisition of $73,906, capital expenditures of $21,733, treasury stock purchases of $11,746, dividends paid of $5,238, and taxes paid on behalf of equity award participants of $2,657. Total debt as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, was $99,700 and $50,000, respectively. Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, defined as long-term debt as a percentage of total debt and shareholders’ equity, was 19.7% at December 31, 2019, compared to 11.7% at December 31, 2018.\n\nWorking capital increased by $5,164 from December 31, 2018, to December 31, 2019, driven mainly by the decrease in accrued payroll and benefits due to lower short-term incentive compensation and the decrease in accounts payable, which were partially offset by an increase in operating lease obligations.\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $64,405 during the year ended December 31, 2019. Components of net cash provided by operating activities included net earnings of $36,146, depreciation and amortization expense of $24,619, stock-based compensation of $5,015, other net non-cash items totaling $5,160, and a net cash outflow from changes in assets and liabilities of $6,535.\n\nCTS CORPORATION 21\n\n(3,343)\n\n1,284\n\n3,817\n\n1,758\n\n64."

Other revenues consist of hardware revenues, which are grouped within the “Professional service and other” category because they are relatively immaterial to our service revenues. Professional services are typically performed after the purchase of new software licenses. Professional service and other revenues can vary from period to period based on the type of engagements as well as those implementations that are assumed by our partner network.\n\nCost of professional service and other revenues consists primarily of the costs of providing integration, configuration and\n\ntraining with respect to our various software products.

Adjusted gross margin represents gross profit plus amortization of acquired intangibles and stock-based compensation. Adjusted gross margin is a measure used by management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to generate future operating plans. The exclusion of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis. In the near term, we expect these expenses to continue to negatively impact our gross profit. Adjusted gross margin is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that adjusted gross margin provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Nevertheless, our use of adjusted gross margin has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP.

Business Segments\n\nWe primarily derive our revenues from sales of our proprietary software (either as a direct license sale or under a subscription delivery model), which\n\nalso serves as the basis for our recurring service contracts for software support and maintenance and certain transaction-related services. In addition, we provide various other client services, including installation, and managed services such as outsourcing, private cloud hosting and revenue cycle management.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, we realigned our reporting structure as a result of the divestiture of our investment in Netsmart on December 31,\n\n2018, the evolution of the healthcare IT industry and our increased focus on the payer and life sciences market. As a result, we changed the presentation of our reportable segments to Provider and Veradigm. The new Provider segment is comprised of our core integrated clinical software applications, financial management and patient engagement solutions targeted at clients across the entire continuum of care. The new Veradigm segment primarily focuses on the payer and life sciences market. These changes to our reportable segments had no impact on operating segments. The segment disclosures below for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 have been revised to our current presentation.\n\nWe sold all of our investment in Netsmart on December 31, 2018. Prior to the sale, Netsmart comprised a separate reportable segment, which due to its significance to our historical consolidated financial statements and results of operations, is reported as a discontinued operation as a result of the sale. In addition, the results of operations related to two of the product offerings acquired with the EIS Business (Horizon Clinicals and Series2000) are also presented throughout these financial statements as discontinued operations and are included within the Provider reportable segment, except for acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments, which are included in “Unallocated Amounts”. Refer to Note 17, “Discontinued Operations.”\n\nAs a result of the above changes, as of December 31, 2019, we had eight operating segments, which are aggregated into two reportable segments. The\n\nProvider reportable segment includes the Hospitals and Health Systems, Ambulatory, CarePort, FollowMyHealth®, EPSiTM, EIS-Classics and 2bPrecise strategic business units, each of which represents a separate operating segment. This reportable segment derives its revenue from the sale of integrated clinical software applications, financial management and patient engagement solutions, which primarily include EHR-related software, connectivity and coordinated care solutions, financial and practice management software, related installation, support and maintenance, outsourcing, private cloud hosting, revenue cycle management, training and electronic claims administration services. The Veradigm reportable segment is comprised of the Veradigm business unit, which represents a separate operating segment. This reportable segment provides data-driven clinical insights with actionable tools for clinical workflow, research, analytics and media. Its solutions, targeted at key healthcare stakeholders, help improve the quality, efficiency and value of healthcare delivery.\n\n104\n\n10,949 1,044 11,993\n\n2,918 261 3,179 8,814 1,148\n\n7,666 (2,990)\n\n",

            "82\n\nFinancials – Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nNote F1, cont’d.\n\nImpairment of trade receivables and contract assets Trade receivables and contract assets are assessed for impairment under a unified model. The Company has determined that credit risk largely depends on both the risk in the country where the customer resides (e.g. ability to make cross border payments) as well as the payment pattern of the customer. There- fore, expected credit losses (ECLs) are calculated using a provision matrix that specifies a fixed rate depending both on the number of days past due and the country risk rating. The country risk ratings depends on the ratings used by all Export Credit Agencies within the OECD. The rates defined in the provision matrix are based on historical loss patterns for that grouping of customers. These rates are adjusted for current conditions as well as management expec- tations for changes to political risks and payment patterns in the future. The provision rates are higher on high risk countries compared to low risk countries and also higher on amounts that remain unpaid for longer periods of time. There were no significant changes to the model during the year.\n\nTrade receivables and contract assets together amounted to SEK 55,240 (64,350) million as of December 31, 2019. Provisions for expected credit losses on trade receivables and contract assets amounted to SEK 2,983 (4,123) million as of December 31, 2019. The allowance decreased in 2019 due to improvement in cash collection resulting in significant reduction of total past due invoices. The Company’s write-offs have historically been low. During the year SEK 382 (890) million were written off due to the Company having no reasonable expectation of collection. Of these write-offs, SEK 0 (61) million are still subject to enforcement.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, the total amount payable to the Company under customer finance credits was SEK 5,924 (4,247) million. The carrying value of these assets was SEK 3,756 (2,883) million as of December 31, 2019, which represents the maximum exposure to credit risk on these assets. Customer finance is arranged for infrastructure projects in different geographic markets. As of December 31, 2019, there were a total of 80 (94) customer finance arrangements originated by or guaranteed by the Company. The five largest facilities represented 69% (62%) of the customer finance exposure in 2019. As of December 31, 2019, Middle East and Africa made up 49% (57%) of the oustanding exposure while South East Asia, Oceania and India made up 29% (15%). As of December 31, 2019, the Company also had unutilized customer finance commitments of SEK 25,854 (30,270) million.\n\nSecurity arrangements for customer finance facilities may include pledges of equipment, pledges of certain assets belonging to the borrower and pledges of shares in the operating company. If available, third-party risk coverage is, as a rule, arranged. “Third-party risk coverage” means that a financial payment guarantee covering the credit risk has been issued by a bank, an export credit agency or an insurance company. All such institutions have been rated at least investment grade. A credit risk transfer under a sub-participation arrange- ment with a bank can also be arranged. In this case the entire credit risk and the funding is taken care of by the bank for the part that they cover.\n\nInformation about financial guarantees related to customer finance is\n\nincluded in note D2, “Contingent liabilities.”\n\nThe table below summarizes the Company’s outstanding customer finance\n\nas of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\nMovements in allowances for impairment of trade receivables and contract assets\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nOutstanding customer finance credit risk exposure 1)\n\nOpening balance Decrease (–)/increase (+) in allowance Write-offs Translation difference Closing balance 1)\n\n1) Of which SEK 0 (15) million relates to contract assets.\n\n4,123 –737 –382 –21\n\n2,983\n\n4,575 420 –890 18\n\n4,123\n\nFair value of customer finance credits Financial guarantees for third-parties Accrued interest\n\nMaximum exposure to credit risk Less third-party risk coverage\n\n2019\n\n3,756 24 14\n\n3,794 –309\n\n2018\n\n2,883 42 21\n\n2,946 –331\n\nThe Company’s risk exposure, less third-party risk coverage\n\n3,485\n\n2,615\n\nThe distribution of trade receivables and contract assets closely follows the distribution of the Company’s sales, see note B1, “Segment information.” The ten largest customers represented 49% (53%) of the total trade receivables and contract assets in 2019.\n\nAging analysis of gross values by risk category at December 31, 2019\n\nDays past due\n\n1–90\n\n91–180\n\n181–360\n\n>360\n\nCountry risk: Low Country risk: Medium Country risk: High\n\n1,347 891 583\n\n125 725 365\n\n127 600 217\n\n313 819 1,315\n\nTotal past due\n\n2,821\n\n1,215\n\n944\n\n2,447\n\nCustomer finance credit risk All major commitments to finance customers are made only after approval in accordance with the work procedure for the Board of Directors and according to the established credit approval process.\n\nTotal\n\n1,912 3,035 2,480\n\n7,427\n\n1) This table has been adjusted to show the maximum exposure to credit risk.\n\nFair value assessment of customer finance credits Customer finance risk exposures are held at fair value and are classified as Level 3 on the fair value hierarchy. The Credit Asset Management Team within Ericsson Credit AB, reporting to Head of Group Treasury and Customer Finance, has established a process with respect to measurement of fair values. The quarterly credit review uses an internal model to determine a commercial rating for each credit and for calculation of the fair value. The model is based on exter- nal credit rating, political/country rating and bank pricing. Regular monitoring of customer behavior is also a part of the internal assessment. Revaluation of customer finance amounted to a net negative impact in the income statement of SEK 804 (1,073) million in 2019, of which SEK 804 (1,073) million is related to credits held as of December 31, 2019. This effect is presented within selling and administrative expenses and was mainly related to India and the Middle East, especially Iran and Iraq.\n\nPrior to the approval of new facilities reported as customer finance, an internal credit risk assessment is conducted in order to assess the credit rating of each transaction for political and commercial risk. The credit risk analysis is made by using an assessment tool, where the political risk rating is identical to the rating used by all Export Credit Agencies within the OECD. The commercial risk is assessed by analyzing a large number of parameters, which may affect the level of the future commercial credit risk exposure. The output from the assessment tool for the credit rating also includes an internal pricing of the risk. This is expressed as a risk margin per annum over funding cost.",
            "Notes to the financial statements continued\n\n27 Financial risk management (continued) Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a tenant or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract. Credit risk arises primarily from trade receivables but also from other financial assets with counterparties including loans to joint ventures, cash deposits and derivative financial instruments.\n\n– trade receivables Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed; tenants are typically invoiced quarterly in advance and are managed individually by asset managers, who continuously monitor and work with tenants, aiming wherever possible to identify and address risks prior to default.\n\nProspective tenants are assessed via a review process, including obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial information, which is conducted internally. As a result deposits or guarantees may be obtained. The amount of deposits held as collateral at 31 December 2019 is £3.5 million (2018: £3.5 million).\n\nWhen applying a loss allowance for expected credit losses, judgement is exercised as to the collectability of trade receivables and to determine if it is appropriate to impair these assets. When considering expected credit losses, management has taken into account days past due, credit status of the counterparty and historical evidence of collection.\n\nThe ageing analysis of trade receivables is as follows:\n\n£m\n\n2019\n\nUp to three months\n\n29.9\n\nThree to six months\n\n10.0\n\nTrade receivables\n\n39.9\n\nAt 31 December 2019 trade receivables are shown net of a loss allowance totalling £6.1 million (2018: £4.0 million).\n\nThe Group does not use factoring to generate cash flow from trade receivables.\n\n– other financial assets including loans to joint ventures The Group applies the expected credit loss model in respect of other financial assets. Financial assets are individually assessed as to whether the credit risk has increased significantly in the period and therefore whether there is a need to apply the lifetime expected credit losses model as opposed to the 12-month expected credit loss model.\n\nAt 31 December 2019 there is no loss allowance recognised for other financial assets as it has been concluded as an immaterial risk of credit loss on other financial assets.\n\n– cash deposits and derivative financial instruments The credit risk relating to cash deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by the Group’s treasury department. Relationships are maintained with a number of tier one institutional counterparties, ensuring compliance with Group policy relating to limits on the credit ratings of counterparties (between BBB+ and AAA).\n\nExcessive credit risk concentration is avoided through adhering to authorised limits for all counterparties.\n\nCounterparty\n\nCredit rating\n\nAuthorised limit £m\n\nGroup exposure 31 December 2019 £m\n\nCredit rating\n\nAuthorised limit £m\n\nCounterparty #1\n\nAA-\n\n125.0\n\n64.9\n\nAA-\n\n125.0\n\nCounterparty #2\n\nAAA\n\n150.0\n\n43.1\n\nA+\n\n100.0\n\nCounterparty #3\n\nA+\n\n100.0\n\n38.7\n\nA\n\n100.0\n\nCounterparty #4\n\nA\n\n100.0\n\n26.0\n\nAAA\n\n150.0\n\nCounterparty #5\n\nA\n\n75.0\n\n20.0\n\nAAA\n\n150.0\n\nSum of five largest exposures\n\n192.7\n\nSum of cash deposits and derivative financial instrument assets\n\n203.5\n\nFive largest exposures as a percentage of assets at risk\n\n95%\n\n144 144\n\nintu properties plc Annual report 2019 intu properties plc Annual report 2019\n\n2018\n\n32.1\n\n3.7\n\n35.8\n\nGroup exposure 31 December 2018 £m\n\n111.9\n\n44.1\n\n27.2\n\n22.3\n\n12.3\n\n217.8\n\n244.2\n\n",
            "Cash Equivalents\n\nOur cash equivalents consist of bank time deposits. Since these are short-term highly liquid investments with remaining\n\nmaturities of 3 months or less, they present negligible risk of changes in fair value due to changes in interest rates and are Level 1.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n\nOur foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency options, interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps are recorded at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets using a discounted cash flow analysis that incorporates observable market inputs. These market inputs include foreign currency spot and forward rates, and various interest rate curves, and are obtained from pricing data quoted by various banks, third-party sources and foreign currency dealers involving identical or comparable instruments and are Level 2.\n\nCounterparties to these foreign currency forward contracts have at least an investment grade rating. Credit ratings on\n\nsome of our counterparties may change during the term of our financial instruments. We closely monitor our counterparties’ credit ratings and, if necessary, will make any appropriate changes to our financial instruments. The fair value generally reflects the estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date.\n\nForeign currency forward contracts and options are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other\n\ncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\nOther Financial Instruments\n\nThe following financial instruments are recorded at fair value or at amounts that approximate fair value: (1) trade receivables, net, (2) certain other current assets, (3) accounts payable and (4) other current liabilities. The carrying amounts reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the above financial instruments closely approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.\n\nOther liabilities that are recorded at carrying value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets include our credit facilities and\n\nsenior notes. We utilize a market approach to calculate the fair value of our senior notes. Due to their limited investor base and the face value of some of our senior notes, they may not be actively traded on the date we calculate their fair value. Therefore, we may utilize prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving similar securities, reflecting U.S. Treasury yields to calculate the yield to maturity and the price on some of our senior notes. These inputs are provided by an independent third party and are considered to be Level 2 inputs.\n\nWe derive our fair value estimates of our various other debt instruments by evaluating the nature and terms of each instrument, considering prevailing economic and market conditions, and examining the cost of similar debt offered at the balance sheet date. We also incorporated our credit default swap rates and currency specific swap rates in the valuation of each debt instrument, as applicable.\n\nThese estimates are subjective and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment, and therefore we cannot\n\ndetermine them with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect our estimates.\n\nThe table below shows the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our debt, excluding lease liabilities:\n\n110\n\nDecember 31, 2019\n\nDecember 31, 2018\n\n(In millions)\n\nCarrying Amount\n\nFair Value\n\nCarrying Amount\n\nFair Value\n\nTerm Loan A Facility due July 2022 Term Loan A Facility due July 2023(1) 6.50% Senior Notes due December 2020 4.875% Senior Notes due December 2022 5.25% Senior Notes due April 2023 4.50% Senior Notes due September 2023(1) 5.125% Senior Notes due December 2024 5.50% Senior Notes due September 2025 4.00% Senior Notes due December 2027 6.875% Senior Notes due July 2033 Other foreign borrowings(1) Other domestic borrowings Total debt(2)\n\n$\n\n474.6 $ 223.8 — 421.9 422.0 445.6 421.9 397.4 420.4 445.7 12.1 89.0 3,774.4 $\n\n474.6 $ 223.8 — 450.1 454.1 509.5 458.9 441.2 431.5 528.8 12.4 89.0 4,073.9 $\n\n— $\n\n222.2 424.0 421.1 421.2 454.9 421.3 397.1 — 445.5 98.5 168.4 3,474.2 $\n\n— 222.2 440.1 421.2 424.5 489.9 419.8 394.8 — 453.4 99.2 170.0 3,535.1\n\n$\n\n(1)\n\nIncludes borrowings denominated in currencies other than US Dollars.\n\n(2)\n\nAt December 31, 2019, the carrying amount and estimated fair value of debt exclude lease liabilities.\n\nIn addition to the table above, the Company remeasures amounts related to certain equity compensation that are carried at\n\nfair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Financial Statements or for which a fair value measurement was required. Refer to Note 21, “Stockholders’ Deficit,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for share-based compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Included among our non-financial assets and liabilities that are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis are inventories, net property and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets and asset retirement obligations.\n\nCredit and Market Risk\n\nFinancial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest or currency exchange rates. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, establishing credit limits, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk.\n\nWe do not expect any of our counterparties in derivative transactions to fail to perform as it is our policy to have counterparties to these contracts that have at least an investment grade rating. Nevertheless, there is a risk that our exposure to losses arising out of derivative contracts could be material if the counterparties to these agreements fail to perform their obligations. We will replace counterparties if a credit downgrade is deemed to increase our risk to unacceptable levels.\n\nWe regularly monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments.\n\nWe continually monitor the creditworthiness of our diverse base of customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business and generally do not require collateral. We consider the concentrations of credit risk associated with our trade accounts receivable to be commercially reasonable and believe that such concentrations do not leave us vulnerable to significant risks of near-term severe adverse impacts. The terms and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. Our sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers.\n\n"

The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $0.7 million, $0.9 million and $8.9 million for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Stock Options with Time-based Vesting CriteriaIn November 2017, we granted 10,924 incentive stock options and 69,076 non-qualified stock options with a total grant date fair value of $17.55 per share,or $1.4 million. These stock options were valued using a Black-Scholes model, using a volatility rate of 45.7%, a risk-free rate of 2.21%, a strike priceof $36.61 and an expected term of 6.5 years. Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period which approximated4.5 years for these awards. These awards were included in the cancellation during the fiscal first quarter of 2019 as discussed in the section below.Stock Options with Market-based Vesting CriteriaWe grant NQs that are subject to vesting only upon the market price of our underlying public stock closing above a certain price target within seven years ofthe date of grant. Share-based compensation expense is recognized regardless of the number of awards that are earned based on the market condition and isrecognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated service period of approximately three years. If the required service period is not met for these options, thenthe share-based compensation expense would be reversed. In the event that our common stock achieves the target price per share based on a 30-day trailingaverage prior to the end of the estimated service period, any remaining unamortized compensation cost will be recognized.Stock options with market-based vesting criteria granted for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 were 585,000, 325,000 and 320,000, respectively, atweighted average grant date fair values of $7.47, $15.52 and $13.18 per share, or total grant date fair value $2.4 million, $5.0 million and $4.3 million,respectively."

The SIP shareholders are entitled to dividends over the Vesting Period. There are no performance conditions applicable to the vesting of SIP shares.

Options exercised prior to the vesting date relate to those attributable to good leavers as defined by the scheme rules.\n\nPerformance Share Plan The Group operates a Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) for Executive Directors, the Operating Leadership Team and certain key employees. The extent to which awards vest will depend upon the Group’s performance over the three-year period following the award date. Both market based and non-market based performance conditions may be attached to the options, for which an appropriate adjustment is made when calculating the fair value of an option. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire. Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest, unless under exceptional circumstances.\n\nOn 17 August 2018, the Group awarded 452,695 nil cost options under the PSP scheme. For the 2018 awards, the Group’s performance is measured by reference to the growth in Operating profit (75% of the award) and growth in Revenue (25% of the award) over the three-year period April 2018 – March 2021. For previous awards, the Group’s performance had been measured by reference to the cumulative profit measure (Underlying operating profit for 2015 and 2016 awards, and Operating profit for 2017 awards) and total shareholder return relative to the FTSE 250 share index.\n\n",
            " The amount of incremental PRSU awards thatcould ultimately vest if all performance criteria are achieved would be 1,196,337 shares assuming a maximum of 300% of the targeted shares.We granted 200,000 market-based RSUs during fiscal year 2019, at a weighted average grant date fair value of $17.65 per share, and a total fair value of $3.5million. Recipients may earn between 0% and 150% of the target number of shares based on the Company's achievement of total shareholder return in comparisonto a peer group of companies in the Nasdaq composite index over a period of approximately three years. The fair value of the awards was estimated using a MonteCarlo simulation and compensation expense is recognized ratably over the service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards of $3.5 million subject tothe market condition. The expected volatility of the Company's common stock was estimated based on the historical average volatility rate over the three-yearperiod. The dividend yield assumption was based on historical and anticipated dividend payouts. The risk-free rate assumption was based on observed interest ratesconsistent with the three-year measurement period. The assumptions used to value the awards are as follows:79",

In conjunction with the changes to reporting units, we reassigned goodwill between CGD and CMS based on their relative fair values on October 1, 2017.\n\nIn July 2017, we acquired Deltenna, a wireless infrastructure company specializing in the design and delivery of radio and antenna communication solutions. Deltenna’s operations were included in our CGD reporting unit upon its acquisition. On April 1, 2019, we reorganized our reporting structure to include Deltenna in our CMS reporting unit and reassigned $3.4 million of goodwill from CGD to CMS based upon its relative fair value. Since its acquisition, Deltenna’s sales, operating results, and cash flows have not been significant to our consolidated results. As such, reportable segment information has not been restated for this change in the composition of our reportable segments.\n\nWe complete our annual goodwill impairment test each year as of July 1 separately for our CTS, CGD and CMS reporting units.\n\nThe test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process. The first step of the test is performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including recorded goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment, if any, by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount. Any resulting impairment determined would be recorded in the current period.\n\nFor our 2019 impairment test, the estimated fair value of all three of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts. As such, there was no impairment of goodwill in 2019.\n\nSignificant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that are used in our impairment analysis. The estimates we used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business. Although we believe our underlying assumptions supporting these assessments are reasonable, if our forecasted sales and margin growth rates, timing of growth, or the discount rate vary from our forecasts, we may be required to perform interim analyses in fiscal 2020 that could expose us to material impairment charges in the future.\n\n107\n\nTotal\n\n",
            "Financial Statements\n\n2019 Annual Report and Accounts\n\nStrategic ReportCorporate GovernanceAdditional InformationIntroduction\n\n17 Impairment of Goodwill and Intangibles\n\nBefore recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows:\n\n31 March 2019 $M\n\n31 March 2018 $M\n\nAmericas\n\n273.6\n\n288.2\n\nEMEA\n\n413.0\n\n434.2\n\nAPJ\n\n98.7\n\n103.6\n\n785.3\n\n826.0\n\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets is tested annually, or more frequently where there is indication of impairment.\n\nWhere the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\nGoodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the cash-generating unit to which it relates is greater than the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use.\n\nFor the year-ended 31 March 2019, the Directors have reviewed the value of goodwill based on internal value in use calculations. The key assumptions for these calculations are discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to billings and direct costs during the period.\n\nThe Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the Directors’ most recent financial forecasts for the following five years. The growth rates for the five-year period are based on Directors’ expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the cash-generating unit, planned growth in market share, industry forecasts, growth in the market and specific regional considerations and are in line with past experience. Discount rates have been estimated based on rates that reflect current market assessments of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital.\n\nThe key assumptions used in the assessments in the year-ended 31 March 2019 are as follows:\n\nAmericas\n\nEMEA\n\nAPJ\n\nLong-term regional growth rate beyond five years\n\n2.5%\n\n1.5%\n\n2.0%\n\nDiscount rate\n\n9.0%\n\n9.0%\n\n10.0%\n\nThe key assumptions used in the assessments in the year-ended 31 March 2018 were as follows:\n\nAmericas\n\nEMEA\n\nAPJ\n\nLong-term regional growth rate beyond five years\n\n2.5%\n\n1.5%\n\n2.0%\n\nDiscount rate\n\n9.5%\n\n9.5%\n\n10.5%\n\nAs at 31 March 2019, there were no indicators of impairment that suggested the carrying amounts of the Group’s long-lived assets are not recoverable. In order to assess the sensitivity in the assumptions made, the Directors have flexed the discount rate upward by thirty per cent of the above rates, and noted that this still did not give any indication of impairment.\n\n153"
