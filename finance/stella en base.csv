All eligible employees were awarded free shares (or nil-cost options in the case of employees in Ireland) valued at £3,600 each based on the share price at the time of the Company’s admission to the Stock Exchange in March 2015, subject to a three-year service period (‘Vesting Period’). The SIP shareholders are entitled to dividends over the Vesting Period. There are no performance conditions applicable to the vesting of SIP shares. The fair value of the SIP awards at the grant date was measured to be £2.72 using the Black-Scholes model. The resulting share-based payments charge is being spread evenly over the Vesting Period.\n\nUK SIP\n\n2019 Number\n\n2018 Number\n\nOutstanding at 1 April\n\n690,791\n\n776,045\n\nDividend shares awarded\n\n4,518\n\n9,778\n\nForfeited\n\n(9,275)\n\n(75,986)\n\nReleased\n\n(365,162)\n\n(19,046)\n\nOutstanding at 31 March\n\n320,872\n\n690,791\n\nVested and outstanding at 31 March\n\n320,872\n\n–\n\nThe weighted average market value per ordinary share for SIP awards released in 2019 was 386.1p (2018: 372.0p).

Options exercised prior to the vesting date relate to those attributable to good leavers as defined by the scheme rules.\n\nPerformance Share Plan The Group operates a Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) for Executive Directors, the Operating Leadership Team and certain key employees. The extent to which awards vest will depend upon the Group’s performance over the three-year period following the award date. Both market based and non-market based performance conditions may be attached to the options, for which an appropriate adjustment is made when calculating the fair value of an option. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire. Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest, unless under exceptional circumstances.\n\nOn 17 August 2018, the Group awarded 452,695 nil cost options under the PSP scheme. For the 2018 awards, the Group’s performance is measured by reference to the growth in Operating profit (75% of the award) and growth in Revenue (25% of the award) over the three-year period April 2018 – March 2021. For previous awards, the Group’s performance had been measured by reference to the cumulative profit measure (Underlying operating profit for 2015 and 2016 awards, and Operating profit for 2017 awards) and total shareholder return relative to the FTSE 250 share index.\n\n', ' following potentially dilutive ordinary share equivalents have been excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted-average sharesoutstanding for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 as their effect would have been anti-dilutive for the periods presented (in thousands): Year Ended March 31, 2019 2018 2017 Share options outstanding 6,209 6,230 8,681 Unvested RSUs 550 33 2875']",The weighted average market value per ordinary share for SIP awards released in 2019 was 386.1p.,386.1p,1.0,0.99999999995,0.99999999995,1.0,0.9999999999999994

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $117.5 million and $109.6 million, respectively. The Company also had deferred tax liabilities of $12.3 million and $16.1 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income, if any, the amount and timing of which is uncertain. Based on the available objective evidence, and historical operating performance, management believes that it is more likely than not that all U.S. and certain foreign deferred tax assets are not realizable. Accordingly, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset with a valuation allowance. The net valuation allowance increased by approximately $11.9 million and $10.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $285.9 million which will begin to expire in the year 2020. The Company had state net and foreign operating loss carryforwards of approximately $268.1 million and $24.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has research credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $16.0 million which will begin to expire in the year 2032. The Company also had state net research credit carryforwards for income tax purposes of approximately $18.3 million which can be carried forward indefinitely. The Company also had MAT credit carry forwards for Indian income tax purposes of approximately $0.7 million which will begin to expire in the year 2030.\n\nA reconciliation of the gross unrecognized tax benefit is as follows (in thousands):\n\n2019\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018\n\n2017\n\nUnrecognized tax benefit - beginning balance Increases for tax positions taken in prior years Decreases for tax positions taken in prior years Increases for tax positions taken in current year Unrecognized tax benefit - ending balance\n\n$\n\n$\n\n8,217 $ — — 623 8,840 $\n\n7,527 $ — (242) 932 8,217 $\n\n6,447 16 — 1,064 7,527\n\nThe unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would not impact the Company's effective tax rate as the recognition of these tax benefits would\n\nbe offset by changes in the Company's valuation allowance. The Company does not believe there will be any material changes in its unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months.\n\n93\n\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Due to the\n\nCompany’s historical loss position, all tax years from inception through December 31, 2019 remain open due to unutilized net operating losses.\n\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States and various states and foreign jurisdictions and is subject to examination by various taxing authorities including major jurisdiction like the United States. As such, all its net operating loss and research credit carryforwards that may be used in future years are subject to adjustment, if and when utilized.\n\nUtilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change\n\nlimitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before their utilization.\n\n13.

Leases\n\nThe Company has entered into operating leases primarily for office facilities. These leases have terms which typically range from 1 year\n\nto 5 years, and often include options to renew. These renewal terms can extend the lease term up to 6 years, and are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. Effective January 1, 2019, these operating leases are included as right-of- use assets in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, as a result of the adoption of the new leasing standard as discussed under Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, and represent the Company’s right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The present value of the Company’s obligation to make lease payments are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nBased on the present value of the lease payments for the remaining lease term of the Company's existing leases, the Company recognized 1) right-of-use assets of $8.5 million, adjusted for deferred rent and lease incentives as of the adoption date, and 2) lease liabilities for operating leases of $11.5 million on January 1, 2019.""]",The provided information does not specify the primary reason for the increase in the Company's deferred tax liability.,the Company's decision to take bonus depreciation on qualifying assets placed in service during fiscal 2019.,0.0,0.99999999995,0.99999999995,1.0,0.0

If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment, if any, by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount.

Factors such as asset class allocations, long-term rates of return (actual and expected), and results of periodic asset liability modeling studies are considered when constructing the long-term rate of return assumption for our defined benefit pension plans.\n\nWeighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the plans at the end of each period were\n\nas follows:\n\nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nDiscount rate Rate of compensation increase\n\n2.0% 2.7%\n\n1.8% 2.6%\n\nIn selecting the appropriate discount rate for the plans, the Company uses country-specific information, adjusted to reflect\n\nthe duration of the particular plan. The discount rate was based on highly rated long-term bond indexes and yield curves that match the duration of the plan’s benefit obligations.\n\nDefined Contribution Plans\n\nAutodesk also provides defined contribution plans in certain foreign countries where required by statute. Autodesk’s funding policy for foreign defined contribution plans is consistent with the local requirements in each country. Autodesk’s contributions to these plans were $29.6 million in fiscal 2019, $27.2 million in fiscal 2018, and $26.6 million in fiscal 2017.\n\nCash Balance Plans\n\nAutodesk provides a cash balance plan that insures the risks of disability, death, and longevity, in which the vested\n\npension capital is reinvested and provides a 100% capital and interest guarantee. The weighted-average guaranteed interest crediting rate for cash balance plans was 1.0%, 1.0%, and 1.3% for mandatory retirement savings and 0.3%, 0.3%, and 0.8% for supplementary retirement savings for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\n\nOther Plans\n\nIn addition, Autodesk offers a non-qualified deferred compensation plan to certain key employees whereby they may defer a portion (or all) of their annual compensation until retirement or a different date specified by the employee in accordance with terms of the plan. See Note 7, “Deferred Compensation,” for further discussion.\n\n16. Restructuring and other exit costs, net\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Board of Directors approved a world-wide restructuring plan (“Fiscal 2018 Plan”) to support the Company's strategic priorities of completing the subscription transition, digitizing the Company, and re-imagining manufacturing, construction, and production. Through the restructuring, Autodesk seeks to reduce its investments in areas not aligned with its strategic priorities, including in areas related to research and development and go-to-market activities. At the same time, Autodesk plans to further invest in strategic priority areas related to digital infrastructure, customer success, and construction. By re-balancing resources to better align with the Company’s strategic priorities, Autodesk is positioning itself to meet its long-term goals. This world-wide restructuring plan included a reduction in force of approximately 11% of the Company’s workforce, or 1,027 employees, and the consolidation of certain leased facilities. By January 31, 2019, the personnel and facilities related actions included in this restructuring plan were substantially complete.\n\nDuring Fiscal 2019, restructuring charges under the Fiscal 2018 Plan included $39.2 million in employee termination\n\nbenefits and $3.2 million in lease termination and other exit costs.\n\n2019 Form 10-K 104\n\n2017\n\n1.7% 2.6%\n\nThe following tables set forth the restructuring charges and other facility exit costs, net during the fiscal years ended\n\nJanuary 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\nBalances, January 31, 2018\n\nAdditions\n\nPayments\n\nAdjustments (1)\n\nBalances, January 31, 2019\n\nFiscal 2018 Plan\n\nEmployee terminations costs\n\n$\n\n53.0\n\n$\n\n39.2\n\n$\n\n(89.7) $\n\n(0.5) $\n\n2.0\n\nFacility terminations and other exit costs\n\n2.5\n\n3.2\n\n(5.7)\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n55.5\n\n$\n\n42.4\n\n$\n\n(95.4) $\n\n(0.4) $\n\n2.1\n\nCurrent portion (2)\n\n$\n\n55.5\n\n$\n\n2.1\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n55.5\n\n$\n\n2.1\n\n____________________ (1) Adjustments primarily relate to the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, settlement of lease contracts, and certain write offs related\n\n(2)\n\nto fixed assets.

Compensation and benefits expense decreased by\n\n$2.1 million in 2019, primarily due to reductions in headcount and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense, driven by employee turnover and the decline in our stock price. The decrease was further driven by the reduction in our provision for bad debts of $0.3 million in 2019, primarily due to improved efforts to collect on long outstanding and reserved receivables. We also did not incur restructuring costs in 2019, as compared to 2018 when $0.2 million was incurred as part of the 2018 Restructuring Plan (refer to Note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements).\n\nImpairment of Goodwill\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\nChange\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n$\n\nImpairment of goodwill\n\n$\n\n1,910\n\n$\n\n(dollars in thousands) $\n\n14,740\n\n(12,830)\n\nPercent of revenues, net\n\n4 %\n\n26 %\n\nWe recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, reducing the goodwill balance to zero at that time.

In 2019, there was a net benefit of $0.3 million from the reserve for uncertain foreign tax positions primarily due to the close of the statute of limitations on several such positions during the year. This compared to 2018, when there was a $0.4 million net expense related to the reserve for uncertain foreign tax positions.

If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\nGoodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the cash-generating unit to which it relates is greater than the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use.\n\nFor the year-ended 31 March 2019, the Directors have reviewed the value of goodwill based on internal value in use calculations. The key assumptions for these calculations are discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to billings and direct costs during the period.\n\nThe Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the Directors’ most recent financial forecasts for the following five years. The growth rates for the five-year period are based on Directors’ expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the cash-generating unit, planned growth in market share, industry forecasts, growth in the market and specific regional considerations and are in line with past experience.

How does TORM define loan-to-value (LTV)?,"[""GLOSSARY ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES – continued\n\nEBITDA: TORM defines EBITDA as earnings before financial income and expenses, depreciation, impairment, amortization and taxes. The computation of EBITDA refers to financial income and expenses which the Company deems to be equivalent to “interest” for purposes of presenting EBITDA. Financial expenses consist of interest on borrowings, losses on foreign exchange transactions and bank charges. Financial income consists of interest income and gains on foreign exchange transactions.\n\nEBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by Management and external users of financial statements, such as lenders, to assess TORM's operating performance as well as compliance with the financial covenants and restrictions contained in the Company's financing agreements. TORM believes that EBITDA assists Management and investors by increasing comparability of the Company's performance from period to period. This increased comparability is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects of interest, depreciation, impairment, amortization and taxes.

The increase was primarily attributable to a $11.8 million increase in payroll and related expenses, primarily consisting of salaries and incentive-based compensation, a $8.7 million increase in ERP integration and technology transition costs, a $4.0 million increase in rent and software costs, and a $2.8 million increase in consulting expenses. Additionally, $2.5 million of the overall increase was attributed to 19 additional days of ownership of our TOKIN subsidiary during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.

The net increase in the total valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 is primarily related to the increase of a net operating loss carry forward due to a release of a non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefit and the increase of deferred tax assets in sites with existing valuation allowances. The decrease in domestic federal and state tax credits is primarily related to the utilization of tax credits against the one-time transition tax.\n\nAs of August 31, 2019, the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the remaining earnings from its foreign\n\nsubsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not already been recorded. The accumulated earnings are the most significant component of the basis difference which is indefinitely reinvested.', ""The components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in thousands):\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2019\n\n2018\n\nDeferred tax assets:\n\nCredits and net operating loss carryforward Accrued compensation Deferred revenues Stock-based compensation Property and equipment Purchased intangible assets Operating lease Other deferred tax assets\n\nTotal deferred tax assets Valuation allowance\n\n$\n\n107,163 $ 174 199 6,819 79 38 1,969 1,056 117,497 (107,161)\n\n100,326 240 246 6,811 391 — — 1,533 109,547 (95,301)\n\nDeferred tax liabilities:\n\nBasis difference on purchased intangible assets Operating lease Other deferred tax liabilities\n\nTotal deferred tax liabilities Net deferred tax liabilities\n\n$\n\n3,308 1,297 7,668 12,273 (1,937) $\n\n6,211 — 9,889 16,100 (1,854)\n\nOther deferred tax assets and liabilities are primarily comprised of the tax effects of accounts receivable reserves, sales allowances, deferred\n\nrent, and other miscellaneous accruals.

The Company also had deferred tax liabilities of $12.3 million and $16.1 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income, if any, the amount and timing of which is uncertain. Based on the available objective evidence, and historical operating performance, management believes that it is more likely than not that all U.S. and certain foreign deferred tax assets are not realizable. Accordingly, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset with a valuation allowance. The net valuation allowance increased by approximately $11.9 million and $10.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $285.9 million which will begin to expire in the year 2020.

The Company does not believe there will be any material changes in its unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months.\n\n93\n\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Due to the\n\nCompany’s historical loss position, all tax years from inception through December 31, 2019 remain open due to unutilized net operating losses.\n\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States and various states and foreign jurisdictions and is subject to examination by various taxing authorities including major jurisdiction like the United States. As such, all its net operating loss and research credit carryforwards that may be used in future years are subject to adjustment, if and when utilized.\n\nUtilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change\n\nlimitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before their utilization.\n\n13. Net Income (Loss) per Share\n\nNet Loss per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\n\nThe computation of the Company’s basic and diluted net loss per share is as follows (in thousands, except per share data):\n\n2019\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018\n\nNet loss\n\n$\n\n(37,057)\n\n$\n\n(28,318)\n\n$\n\nWeighted-average number of shares used to compute net loss per share, basic and diluted\n\n91,163\n\n93,676\n\nNet loss per share, basic and diluted\n\n$\n\n(0.41)\n\n$\n\n(0.30)\n\n$\n\nBasic and diluted net loss per share is the same for each period presented, as the inclusion of all potential common shares outstanding would\n\nhave been anti-dilutive.\n\nThe outstanding common equivalent shares excluded from the computation of the diluted net loss per share for the periods presented\n\nbecause including them would have been antidilutive are as follows (in thousands):\n\n2019\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018\n\nStock options and ESPP Restricted stock units Shares held in escrow Shares related to convertible senior notes\n\n8,642 5,023 — 11,521 25,186\n\n6,664 4,904 — 11,521 23,089\n\n14. Leases\n\nThe Company has entered into operating leases primarily for office facilities. These leases have terms which typically range from 1 year\n\nto 5 years, and often include options to renew. These renewal terms can extend the lease term up to 6 years, and are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. Effective January 1, 2019, these operating leases are included as right-of- use assets in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, as a result of the adoption of the new leasing standard as discussed under Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, and represent the Company’s right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The present value of the Company’s obligation to make lease payments are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nBased on the present value of the lease payments for the remaining lease term of the Company's existing leases, the Company recognized 1) right-of-use assets of $8.5 million, adjusted for deferred rent and lease incentives as of the adoption date, and 2) lease liabilities for operating leases of $11.5 million on January 1, 2019.""]","The table provides information for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019, and August 31, 2018, as well as for the years ended December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018.","2019, 2018",1.0,0.99999999995,0.99999999995,0.5,0.8365520928570133
What does the recorded investment include?,"[""Table of Contents\n\nShort-term Investments\n\nCertificates of deposit held for investment with an original maturity greater than 90 days and less than one year are carried at cost and reported as Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The certificates of deposit are not debt securities.\n\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents and trade receivables. The Company currently invests its excess cash in government and prime money market funds. The cash in the Company’s U.S. banks is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to the insurable limit of $250,000.\n\nIncome (Loss) per Share\n\nThe computation of basic net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share includes the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares had been issued. In periods with a net loss, all common stock equivalents are excluded from the per share calculation; therefore, the basic loss per share equals the diluted loss per share.\n\nInventories and Inventory Valuation\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market value. Market value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by estimated costs of disposal. Should actual market conditions differ from the Company’s estimates, the Company’s future results of operations could be materially affected. Reductions in inventory valuation are included in Cost of revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company reviews inventory for excess quantities and obsolescence based on its best estimates of future demand, product lifecycle status and product development plans. The Company uses historical information along with these future estimates to reduce the inventory cost basis. Subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. Prices anticipated for future inventory demand are compared to current and committed inventory values.\n\nThe components of inventories are as follows:\n\nMarch 31,\n\n(in thousands) Raw materials\n\nFinished goods\n\n$\n\n2019\n\n3,445 $ 6,356\n\nTotal inventories\n\n$\n\n9,801 $\n\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets\n\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets generally consist of prepaid product royalty, prepaid maintenance agreements and prepaid rent, which are amortized as expense generally over the term of the underlying contract or estimated product life.\n\nLand, Property and Equipment\n\nLand, property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or for leasehold improvements, the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives for machinery and equipment range from 5 to 7 years and for office, computer and research equipment from 2 to 5 years. Expenditures for major renewals and improvements that extend the useful life of property and equipment are capitalized.\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $0.6 million and $0.8 million for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. In accordance with ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment (ASC 360), the Company assesses all of its long-lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment when impairment indicators are identified. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss may be necessary. An impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset.\n\nThe Company acquired 16 acres of land with an acquisition and sold 4 acres in April 2015 for $264,000. The Company still owns 12 acres of land that remains on the market. The Company concluded that a sale transaction for the remaining land is not probable within the next year; therefore, unsold land is classified as held-and-used as of March 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\n37-\n\n2018\n\n2,969 6,253\n\n9,222\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe components of fixed assets are as follows:\n\nMarch 31,\n\n(in thousands) Land\n\n$\n\n2019\n\n672 $\n\nMachinery and equipment Office, computer and research equipment Leasehold improvements\n\n1,372 5,267 798\n\nLand, property and equipment, gross\n\nLess accumulated depreciation and amortization\n\n$\n\n8,109 $ (6,811 )\n\nLand, property and equipment, net\n\n$\n\n1,298 $\n\nIntangible Assets\n\nIntangible assets with determinable lives are amortized on a straight-line basis or the consumption period based on expected cash flows from the underlying intangible asset over their respective estimated useful lives. If the Company were to determine that a change to the remaining estimated useful life of an intangible asset was necessary, then the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. On an ongoing basis, the Company reviews intangible assets with a definite life and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that carrying values may not be recoverable. If such events or changes in circumstances occur, the Company will recognize an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flow expected to be generated by the asset is less than the carrying value of the related asset. Any impairment loss would adjust the asset to its implied fair value.\n\nSee Note 4, Intangible Assets for further discussion of intangible assets impairment evaluations.\n\nAccrued Expenses\n\nThe components of accrued expenses are as follows:\n\nMarch 31,\n\n(in thousands) Accrued compensation\n\n$\n\n2019\n\n656 $\n\nAccrued contractual obligation Other accrued expenses\n\n1,445 1,466\n\nTotal accrued expenses\n\n$\n\n3,567 $\n\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\n\nThe Company records revenue based on a five-step model in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers (ASC 606). The Company's revenue is derived from the sale of products, software, and services identified in contracts. A contract exists when both parties have an approved agreement that creates enforceable rights and obligations, identifies performance obligations and payment terms and has commercial substance. The Company records revenue from these contracts when control of the products or services transfer to the customer. The amount of revenue to be recognized is based upon the consideration, including the impact of any variable consideration, that the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these products and services.\n\nThe majority of the Company’s revenue is recorded at a point in time from the sale of tangible products. Revenue is recorded when control of the products passes to the customer, dependent upon the terms of the underlying contract. For right-to-use software, revenue is recognized at the point in time the customer has the right to use and can substantially benefit from use of the software. Products regularly include warranties that include bug fixes, and minor updates so that the product continues to function as promised in a dynamic environment, and phone support. These standard warranties are assurance type warranties which do not offer any services beyond the assurance that the product will continue working as specified. Therefore, warranties are not considered separate performance obligations. Instead, the Company accrues the expected cost of warranty. Extended warranties are sold separately with a post contract support (PCS) agreement. PCS revenue is recognized over time during the support period."", 'Table of Contents\n\nCash flows used in investing activities in fiscal 2018 were $15.1 million.

Respectively, in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, the $0.8 million, $1.3 million, and $0.8 million cash flows used in financing activities were primarily comprised of the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding and to cover the exercise price of the options, and payments on capital lease obligations.\n\nInvestments\n\nInvestments in Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies\n\nAgilysys invests in corporate-owned life insurance policies for certain former executives, for which some are endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements. We entered into non-cancelable agreements with each of the former executives, whereby we must maintain the life insurance policy for a specified amount and split a portion of the policy benefits with their designated beneficiary. Our investment in these corporate-owned life insurance policies were recorded at their cash surrender value, which approximates fair value at the balance sheet date. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the balance sheet date, the cash surrender value of $0.9 million for the remaining policies were held in “Other non-current assets,” and the present value of future proceeds owed to those executives\' designated beneficiary of $0.1 million, which approximates fair value, were recorded within ""Other non-current liabilities"" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the balance sheet date.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\n\nContractual Obligations\n\nThe following table provides aggregate information regarding our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2019.\n\n(In thousands) Operating leases (1) Capital leases Asset retirement obligation Total contractual obligations (2)\n\n$\n\n$\n\nTotal 19,437 $ 65 400 19,902 $\n\n2020\n\n4,143 $ 27 — 4,170 $\n\n2021-2022\n\n7,111 $ 38 150 7,299 $\n\n2023-2024\n\n3,686 $ — 250 3,936 $\n\n(1) Operating lease obligations are presented net of contractually binding sub-lease arrangements.

Volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was flat in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior-year period. This result reflected merchandising changes and price elasticity-related declines in certain brands, as well as isolated production challenges, partially offset by the continued benefit from momentum and innovation successes in the snacks businesses. Price/ mix was flat compared to the prior year as unfavorable mix, coupled with increases in brand building investments with retailers were offset by the impact of higher pricing. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC, which was completed in October 2017, contributed $41.3 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 results included $115.9 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $156.4 million of net sales related to this divested business.\n\nRefrigerated & Frozen net sales for fiscal 2019 were $2.80 billion, an increase of $51.0 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 1% increase in volume compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales volumes was a result of innovation across multiple brands, which was partially offset by the effects of reduced merchandising spend and the impact of a recall during the fourth quarter. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2018, as continued delivery of top-line accretive innovation in several brands was partially offset by brand building investments with retailers. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business, which was completed in February 2018, contributed $25.7 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition.\n\nInternational net sales for fiscal 2019 were $793.4 million, a decrease of $50.1 million, or 6%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 2% increase in volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, a 4% decrease due to foreign exchange rates, and a 2% increase in price/mix, in each case compared to fiscal 2018. The volume and price/ mix increases for fiscal 2019 were driven by growth in the Canadian snacks and frozen businesses. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $3.7 million to International net sales for fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 included $4.1 million of net sales related to our Del Monte® processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada, which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $48.9 million of net sales related to this divested business. In addition, fiscal 2019 and 2018 results included $17.1 million and $24.5 million, respectively, related to our divested Wesson® oil business.\n\nFoodservice net sales for fiscal 2019 were $934.2 million, a decrease of $120.6 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 14% decrease in volume, excluding divestitures. The decline in volume reflected the continued execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy and the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Price/mix increased 5% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in price/mix for fiscal 2019 reflected favorable product and customer mix, the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing, and the execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy. Fiscal 2019 included $34.2 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $53.4 million of net sales related to this divested business. Net sales declined by approximately 7% in fiscal 2019 due to the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility.\n\nPinnacle Foods net sales for fiscal 2019 (reflecting 213 days of Conagra Brands ownership) were $1.73 billion.

Years Ended December 31, All figures in USD ‘000, except TCE rate per day 2019 2018 Variance Voyage Revenue 317,220 289,016 9.8%Less Voyage expenses (141,770) (165,012) (14.1%)Net Voyage Revenue 175,450 124,004 41.5%Vessel Calendar Days (1) 8,395 9,747 (13.9%)Less off-hire days 293 277 5.8%Total TCE days 8,102 9,470 (14.4%)TCE Rate per day (2) $21,655 $13,095 65.4%)Total Days for vessel operating expenses 8,395 9,747 (13.9%)(1)Vessel Calendar Days is the total number of days the vessels were in our fleet.(2)Time Charter Equivalent (“TCE”) Rate, results from Net Voyage Revenue divided by total TCE days.The change in Voyage revenue is due to two main factors:i)The number of TCE daysii)The change in the TCE rate achieved.With regards to i), the decrease in vessel calendar days is mainly due to the disposal of ten vessels in 2018, offset by three 2018 Newbuildings delivered in the latter part of 2018.43\n\nWith regards to ii), the TCE rate increased by $8,560, or 65.4%. The indicative rates presented by Clarksons Shipping increased by 91.7% for the twelve months of 2019compared to the same twelve months in 2018 to $31,560 from $16,466, respectively. The rates presented by Clarksons Shipping were significantly influenced by the spike in the Suezmaxtanker rates in the fourth quarter of both 2019 and 2018. Our average TCE was also positively impacted by the increased tanker rates towards the end of 2019, but not to the same extentas the rates reported by Clarksons Shipping. We expect this spike to materialize to a larger extent in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the rates reported by Clarksons Shipping.As a result of i) and ii) net voyage revenues increased by 41.5% from $124.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to $175.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.Voyage expenses decreased to $141.8 million from $165.0 million, or 14.1%. The decrease in voyage expenses was primarily due to a decrease in vessel calendar days asdiscussed above.Vessel operating expenses decreased by $14.4 million, or 17.9%, from $80.4 million in 2018 to $66.0 million in 2019. This was primarily due to the decrease in our fleet as discussedabove. In cooperation with our technical managers we maintain our focus on keeping the fleet in top technical condition whilst keeping costs low.No impairment loss on vessels has been recorded in 2019 compared to a loss of $2.2 million recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018.General and administrative expenses increased $0.7 million, or 5.9%, from $12.7 million in 2018 to $13.5 million in 2019.Depreciation expenses increased by $3.3 million, or 5.4%, from $60.7 million in 2018 to $64.0 million in 2019. The increase is primarily due to the full-year effect of the threevessels added to the fleet in the latter part of 2018.Interest expenses increased by $3.8 million, or 11.1%, from $34.5 million in 2018 to $38.4 million in 2019. The increase is mainly due to the full year-effect of the loans associatedwith the three vessels added to the fleet in latter part of 2018 and a non-cash expense of about $1.7 million related to the remaining borrowing cost under the Credit Facility that wasrepaid on February 12, 2019.Other financial expenses decreased by $10.6, or 71.4%, from $14.8 million in 2018 to $4.2 million in 2019 mainly due an expense related to fair value change of $3.2 million forInvestment Securities, offset by the cancellation of the Backstop facility in 2018 and expense of the associated fees of $13.4 million.Please see Item 5.

The majority of our shell eggs are sold at independently quoted wholesale market prices for shell eggs or formulas related to our costs of production which include the cost of corn and soybean meal. The following table shows our net income (loss), gross profit, net average shell egg selling price, the average Urner Barry wholesale large shell egg prices in the southeast region, and feed cost per dozen produced for each of our three most recent fiscal years.\n\nFiscal Year ended\n\nJune 1, 2019\n\nJune 2, 2018\n\nJune 3, 2017\n\nNet income (loss) attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. - (in thousands) Gross profit (in thousands) Net average shell egg selling price (rounded) Average Urner Barry Spot Egg Market Quotations 1 Feed cost per dozen produced\n\n$\n\n54,229 $ 222,859 1.27 1.23 0.415\n\n125,932 $ 361,046 1.40 1.49 0.394\n\n(74,278) 45,550 1.01 0.85 0.399\n\n1- Average Thursday price for the large market (i.e. generic shell eggs) in the southeastern region\n\nThe shell egg industry has historically been subject to periods of high profitability followed by periods of significant loss. The periods of high profitability have often reflected increased consumer demand relative to supply while the periods of significant loss have often reflected excess supply for the then prevailing consumer demand. Historically, demand for shell eggs increases in line with overall population growth. As reflected above, our operating results fluctuate with changes in the spot egg market quote and feed costs. The net average shell egg selling price is the blended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs, including non-graded shell egg sales, breaking stock and undergrades. In fiscal 2017, our net average selling price and dozens sold decreased over the previous fiscal year primarily due to the oversupply of eggs resulting from the repopulation of the national flock of laying hens to levels exceeding the flock size prior to the avian influenza outbreak in 2015, along with a reduced demand for egg products. In fiscal 2018, strong demand resulted in an increase in our average selling price and dozens sold, and feed costs decreased over prior years. Fiscal 2019 saw an increasing U.S. flock size result in oversupply of eggs, particularly in the last half of the fiscal year. This resulted in decreased gross profit and net income for fiscal 2019.\n\n24\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFiscal Year Ended June 1, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 2, 2018\n\nNET SALES\n\nNet sales for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019 were $1,361.2 million, a decrease of $141.7 million, or 9.4%, from net sales of $1,502.9 million for fiscal 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower selling prices for non-specialty eggs in fiscal 2019 due to the oversupply of eggs, particularly in the last half of the fiscal year, contrasted with fiscal 2018 in which we experienced strong demand resulting in higher prices for non-specialty eggs.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, shell egg sales made up approximately 97% of our net sales. Total dozens sold in fiscal 2019 were 1,038.9 million, an increase of 1.2 million dozen, or 0.1%, compared to 1,037.7 million sold in fiscal 2018 resulting in an increase in net sales of $1.7 million for fiscal 2019 compared with the prior year.\n\nNet average selling price of shell eggs decreased from $1.397 per dozen for fiscal 2018 to $1.265 per dozen for fiscal 2019, a decrease of $0.132 per dozen, or 9.4%, primarily reflecting an abundance of eggs in the market. The decrease in sales price in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2018 resulted in a corresponding decrease in net sales of approximately $137.1 million. Our operating results are significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices, which are outside of our control. Small changes in production or demand levels can have a large effect on shell egg prices.\n\nEgg products accounted for approximately 3% of our net sales. These revenues were $41.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019 compared with $43.5 million for the fiscal 2018.\n\nThe table below represents an analysis of our non-specialty and specialty, as well as co-pack specialty, shell egg sales.

What is the number of non-vested shares granted in 2019?,"['Stock Awards\n\nWe have granted RSUs to our employees, consultants and members of our Board of Directors, and PSUs to\n\ncertain executives.\n\nIn February 2016, we granted 547,000 PSUs with certain financial and operational targets. Actual performance, as measured at the time and prior to the restatement of the 2016 financial statements, resulted in participants achieving 80% of target. Given the PSUs did not contain explicit or implicit claw back rights, there was no change to stock-based compensation expense for the impact of the previously disclosed restatement of the 2016 consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2019, 253,203 shares had vested, 200,297 shares had been forfeited, and the remaining 93,500 shares will vest (as to 80%) in annual tranches through February 2020 subject to continued service vesting requirements.\n\nIn October 2018, we granted 464,888 PSUs with certain financial targets. These PSUs will become eligible to vest at 75% upon the achievement of the performance targets by December 31, 2020, and are subject to service condition vesting requirements. The remaining 25% of these PSUs will become eligible to vest on the first anniversary of the initial vesting date. None of these PSUs were vested as of December 31, 2019.\n\nIn April 2019, we granted 346,453 PSUs with certain financial targets. These PSUs will become eligible to vest at 75% on the second month following achievement of certain performance targets by December 31, 2021, with the remaining 25% of the PSUs to vest on the first anniversary of the initial vesting date, subject to continued service vesting requirements. None of these PSUs were vested as of December 31, 2019.\n\nIn December 2019, we granted 375,000 PSUs with certain market performance-based targets to be achieved between December 2019 and December 2023. One-third of each tranche of these PSUs will become eligible to vest on each of the three anniversaries of the date the performance-based target is achieved, subject to continued service vesting requirements. The grant date fair values of each tranche of these PSUs were estimated to be $4.59, $4.06 and $3.59 and determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model with the following assumptions: expected term of 4.0 years, expected volatility of 38.45%, risk-free interest rate of 1.7% and expected dividend yield of 0.0%.

When is the impairment of goodwill and tangible assets tested?,"['2019 Annual Report and Accounts\n\nStrategic ReportCorporate GovernanceAdditional InformationIntroduction\n\nFinancial Statements\n\n17 Impairment of Goodwill and Intangibles\n\nBefore recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows:\n\n31 March 2019 $M\n\n31 March 2018 $M\n\nAmericas\n\n273.6\n\n288.2\n\nEMEA\n\n413.0\n\n434.2\n\nAPJ\n\n98.7\n\n103.6\n\n785.3\n\n826.0\n\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets is tested annually, or more frequently where there is indication of impairment.\n\nWhere the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\nGoodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the cash-generating unit to which it relates is greater than the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use.\n\nFor the year-ended 31 March 2019, the Directors have reviewed the value of goodwill based on internal value in use calculations. The key assumptions for these calculations are discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to billings and direct costs during the period.\n\nThe Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the Directors’ most recent financial forecasts for the following five years. The growth rates for the five-year period are based on Directors’ expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the cash-generating unit, planned growth in market share, industry forecasts, growth in the market and specific regional considerations and are in line with past experience. Discount rates have been estimated based on rates that reflect current market assessments of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital.\n\nThe key assumptions used in the assessments in the year-ended 31 March 2019 are as follows:\n\nAmericas\n\nEMEA\n\nAPJ\n\nLong-term regional growth rate beyond five years\n\n2.5%\n\n1.5%\n\n2.0%\n\nDiscount rate\n\n9.0%\n\n9.0%\n\n10.0%\n\nThe key assumptions used in the assessments in the year-ended 31 March 2018 were as follows:\n\nAmericas\n\nEMEA\n\nAPJ\n\nLong-term regional growth rate beyond five years\n\n2.5%\n\n1.5%\n\n2.0%\n\nDiscount rate\n\n9.5%\n\n9.5%\n\n10.5%\n\nAs at 31 March 2019, there were no indicators of impairment that suggested the carrying amounts of the Group’s long-lived assets are not recoverable. In order to assess the sensitivity in the assumptions made, the Directors have flexed the discount rate upward by thirty per cent of the above rates, and noted that this still did not give any indication of impairment.\n\n153', 'The following table summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the fiscal years ended January 31,\n\n2019 and 2018:\n\nJanuary 31, 2019\n\nJanuary 31, 2018\n\nGoodwill, beginning of the year\n\n$\n\n1,769.4\n\n$\n\n1,710.3\n\nLess: accumulated impairment losses, beginning of the year\n\n(149.2)\n\n(149.2)\n\nAdditions arising from acquisitions during the year\n\n866.9\n\n—\n\nEffect of foreign currency translation, measurement period adjustments, and other (1)\n\n(36.3)\n\n59.1\n\nGoodwill, end of the year\n\n$\n\n2,450.8\n\n$\n\n1,620.2\n\n_______________ (1) Purchase accounting adjustments reflect revisions made to the Company’s preliminary determination of estimated fair value of assets\n\nand liabilities assumed during fiscal 2019 and 2018.\n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nAt least annually or more frequently as circumstances dictate, Autodesk reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever impairment indicators exist. Autodesk continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate the carrying amounts of its long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, Autodesk assesses recoverability of these assets. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the carrying amounts of the assets to the future undiscounted cash flow the assets are expected to generate. If the long-lived assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. Autodesk did not recognize any material impairments of long-lived assets during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\n\nIn addition to the recoverability assessments, Autodesk routinely reviews the remaining estimated useful lives of its long-\n\nlived assets. Any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made, as well as in subsequent quarters.\n\nDeferred Tax Assets\n\nDeferred tax assets arise primarily from tax credits, net operating losses, and timing differences for reserves, accrued liabilities, stock options, deferred revenue, purchased technologies, and capitalized intangibles, partially offset by U.S. deferred tax liabilities on acquired intangibles, and valuation allowances against U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets. Autodesk performed a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets and believes it will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize the net deferred tax assets. They are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce gross deferred tax assets to the amount that is ""more likely than not"" to be realized.\n\nStock-based Compensation Expense\n\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, as\n\nfollows:\n\nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nCost of subscription and maintenance revenue\n\n$\n\n13.2\n\n$\n\n11.9\n\n$\n\n8.6\n\nCost of other revenue\n\n4.3\n\n4.0\n\n5.5\n\nMarketing and sales\n\n109.4\n\n107.3\n\n94.1\n\nResearch and development\n\n82.6\n\n82.9\n\n81.3\n\nGeneral and administrative\n\n40.0\n\n55.3\n\n32.3\n\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock awards and Employee Qualified\n\nStock Purchase Plan (""ESPP"") purchases\n\n249.5\n\n261.4\n\n221.8\n\nTax benefit\n\n(2.6)\n\n(2.6)\n\n(2.6)\n\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock awards and ESPP purchases,\n\nnet\n\n$\n\n246.9\n\n$\n\n258.8\n\n$\n\n219.2\n\n2019 Form 10-K 71\n\nt r o p e R\n\nl a u n n A 9 1 0 2\n\n2 0 1 9 A n n u a l\n\nR e p o r t\n\nAutodesk determines the grant date fair value of its share-based payment awards using a Black-Scholes Merton (""BSM"") option pricing model or the quoted stock price on the date of grant, unless the awards are subject to market conditions, in which case Autodesk uses a binomial-lattice model (e.g., Monte Carlo simulation model).

The expected volatility for performance stock units subject to market conditions includes the expected volatility of Autodesk\'s peer companies within the S&P Computer Software Select Index or S&P North American Technology Software Index with a market capitalization over $2.00 billion, depending on the award type.\n\nAutodesk estimates the expected life of stock-based awards using both exercise behavior and post-vesting termination\n\nbehavior as well as consideration of outstanding options. The range of expected lives of ESPP awards are based upon the four, six-month exercise periods within a 24-month offering period.\n\nAutodesk did not pay cash dividends in fiscal 2019, 2018, or 2017 and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in\n\nthe foreseeable future. Consequently, an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the BSM option pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation model.\n\nThe risk-free interest rate used in the BSM option pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation model for stock-based\n\nawards is the historical yield on U.S. Treasury securities with equivalent remaining lives.\n\nAutodesk recognizes expense only for the stock-based awards that ultimately vest. Autodesk accounts for forfeitures of\n\nstock-based awards as those forfeitures occur.\n\nAdvertising Expenses\n\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred.']","Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets is tested annually, or more frequently where there is an indication of impairment.","tested annually, or more frequently where there is indication of impairment",1.0,0.99999999995,0.99999999995,1.0,0.9637159403980268

As of December 31, 2019, and 2018, we recorded deferred tax assets related to certain U.S. state and non-U.S. income tax loss carryforwards of $4,724 and $4,647, respectively, and U.S. and non- U.S. tax credits of $15,964 and $16,909, respectively. The deferred tax assets expire in various years primarily between 2021 and 2039.\n\nGenerally, we assess if it is more-likely-than-not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized during the available carry-forward periods. As a result, we have determined that valuation allowances of $8,011 and $8,274 should be provided for certain deferred tax assets at December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the valuation allowances relate to certain U.S. state and non-U.S. loss carry-forwards and certain U.S. state tax credits that management does not anticipate will be utilized.\n\nNo valuation allowance was recorded in 2019 against the U.S. federal foreign tax credit carryforwards of $5,785, which expire in varying amounts between 2023 and 2029 as well as the research and development tax credits of $7,495, which expire in varying amounts between 2021 and 2039. We assessed the anticipated realization of those tax credits utilizing future taxable income projections. Based on those projections, management believes it is more-likely-than-not that we will realize the benefits of these credit carryforwards.\n\nThe following table reconciles taxes at the U.S. federal statutory rate to the effective income tax rate:\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nTaxes at the U.S. statutory rate\n\n21.0 %\n\n21.0 %\n\nState income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit\n\n0.4 %\n\n1.2 %\n\nNon-U.S. earnings taxed at rates different than the U.S. statutory rate\n\n1.3 %\n\n0.8 %\n\nForeign source earnings, net of associated foreign tax credits\n\n0.3 %\n\n4.1 %\n\nBenefit of tax credits\n\n(1.5)%\n\n(0.9)%\n\nNon-deductible expenses\n\n4.1 %\n\n1.3 %\n\nStock compensation - excess tax benefits\n\n(1.1)%\n\n(0.9)%\n\nAdjustment to valuation allowances\n\n(0.4)%\n\n(0.6)%\n\nOther changes in tax laws and rates\n\n0.1 %\n\n(6.1)%\n\nChange in unrecognized tax benefits\n\n3.3 %\n\n(1.7)%\n\nImpacts of unremitted foreign earnings\n\n1.3 %\n\n1.1 %\n\nImpacts related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\n\n— %\n\n(0.6)%\n\nOther\n\n(0.7)%\n\n1.2 %\n\nEffective income tax rate\n\n28.1 %\n\n19.9 %\n\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.

General and administrative expenses for the yearended March 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2017 were negatively impacted by approximately $0.3 million primarily as a result of theweakening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and South African rand. Personnel-related costs increased primarily as a result of salaries and benefitsassociated with increased headcount. Share-based compensation expense increased primarily as a result of share option grants since the prior year.Information technology and facility and material supplies costs increased primarily as a result of increased headcount.Restructuring and Impairment of long-lived assetsIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, upon the exit of our Watertown, Massachusetts corporate office space, we recorded a restructuring charge of $0.8million for remaining non-cancelable rent and estimated operating expenses for the vacated premises, net of sublease rentals, and a non-cash impairmentcharge of $1.7 million primarily related to leasehold improvements.Other income (expense) Year ended March 31, Period-to-period change 2018 2017 Amount % Change (dollars in thousands) Other income (expense): Interest income $1,310 $510 $800 157%Interest expense (598) (268) (330) 123%Foreign exchange (expense) income and other, net (3,439) 6,892 (10,331) nm Total other income (expense), net $(2,727) $7,134 $(9,861) nm nm—not meaningful Other income (expense), net changed $9.9 million in the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the year ended March 31, 2017, which was primarilyattributable to a change of $10.4 million in foreign exchange expense which was primarily attributable to the re-measurement of short-term intercompanybalances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our operating units.

We work with our customers to look for the best packaging solutions for all our products, that take into account the environmental impact, while keeping our food fresher for longer. We are committed to working with our customers to reducing our use of single-use plastics and partnering with suppliers to find effective alternatives.\n\nWe support the UK Plastics Pact and are committed to meeting its 2025 targets. We will monitor and reduce the amount of plastics used to transport and consume our products, and we aim to develop a circular system whereby plastic is used less and kept out of the environment. Throughout FY19, we have engaged with all key customers and have plans to remove remaining ‘hard to recycle’ packaging as soon as possible.\n\nOver the last six years, we have made good progress in our water consumption per tonne of product, reducing it by 15% over the period. There was also a significant improvement in FY19, and one of the contributing factors to the improvement was the closure of the Evercreech desserts facility which had a higher water intensity than most sites within the business.\n\nWater consumption per tonne of product – UK manufacturing (m3 per tonne)\n\nIn FY19, we saved 18.7 tonnes of plastic by replacing the black plastic trays in a ready meal range with foil.

For FY18:
- Scope 1: 66,336 tonnes CO2e
- Scope 2: 32,389 tonnes CO2e
- Total gross emissions (Scope 1 and 2) for FY18: 66,336 + 32,389 = 98,725 tonnes CO2e

For FY19:
- Scope 1: 59,495 tonnes CO2e
- Scope 2: 27,633 tonnes CO2e
- Total gross emissions (Scope 1 and 2) for FY19: 59,495 + 27,633 = 87,128 tonnes CO2e

Now, we can calculate the percentage change from FY18 to FY19:

Percentage change = [(Total emissions in FY19 - Total emissions in FY18) / Total emissions in FY18] * 100

Percentage change = [(87,128 - 98,725) / 98,725] * 100
Percentage change = [-11,597 / 98,725] * 100
Percentage change ≈ -11.74%

Therefore, the percentage change in total emissions from FY18 to FY19 is approximately -11.74%.",6.14 per cent,1.0,0.99999999995,0.99999999995,1.0,0.8637420081366155

DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS\n\nAs a result of the Rofin acquisition, we have assumed all assets and liabilities of Rofin’s defined benefit plans for the Rofin-Sinar Laser, GmbH (‘‘RSL’’) and Rofin-Sinar Inc. (‘‘RS Inc.’’) employees. The U.S. plan began in fiscal 1995 and is partially funded. Any new employees hired after January 1, 2007, are not eligible for the RS Inc. pension plan. As is the customary practice with German companies, the German pension plan is unfunded. Any new employees hired after 2000 are not eligible for the RSL pension plan. The measurement date of these pension plans is September 30. For these pension plans, actuarial gains and losses are deferred into OCI and amortized over future periods.\n\nEffective January 1, 2012, the RS Inc. defined benefit plan was amended to exclude highly compensated employees, as defined by the Internal Revenue Service, from receiving future years of service under the RS Inc. defined benefit plan. A non-qualified defined benefit plan was created to replace the benefits lost by the employees that were otherwise excluded from the qualified defined benefit plan. Effective August 31, 2018 both the RS Inc. plans were amended to freeze all future compensation benefit accruals.\n\nIn addition, we have defined benefit plans in South Korea, Japan, Spain and Italy, covering all\n\nfull-time employees with at least one year of service, and a defined benefit plan in Germany covering two individuals. As is the customary practice with European and Asian companies, the plans are unfunded, with the exception of the Spanish plan which is partially funded. We have elected to recognize all actuarial gains and losses on these plans immediately, as incurred. The measurement date of these defined benefit plans is September 30.\n\nFor financial reporting purposes, the calculation of net periodic pension costs is based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations, an assumed rate of return on pension assets and an assumed rate of compensation increase for employees covered by the plan. All of these assumptions were based upon management’s judgment, considering all known trends and uncertainties. Actual results that differ from these assumptions would impact future expense recognition and the cash funding requirements of our defined benefit plans.\n\nComponents of net periodic cost are as follows for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\n\nFiscal\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nService cost . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

These technologies consist of both hardware and software offerings, including software licenses and software-as-a-service (SaaS), that help our customers build networks, automate, orchestrate, integrate, and digitize data. We are shifting and expanding more of our business to software and subscriptions across our core networking portfolio. Our hardware and perpetual software in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses are multiple performance obligations where the term license is recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.\n\nApplications consists of offerings that utilize the core networking and data center platforms to provide their functions. The products consist primarily of software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS, as well as hardware. Our perpetual software and hardware in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses are multiple performance obligations where the term license is recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.\n\nSecurity primarily includes our network security, cloud and email security, identity and access management, advanced threat protection, and unified threat management products. These products consist of both hardware and software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS. Updates and upgrades for the term software licenses are critical for our software to perform its intended commercial purpose because of the continuous need for our software to secure our customers’ network environments against frequent threats. Therefore, security software licenses are generally represented by a single distinct performance obligation with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.\n\nOther Products primarily include our Service Provider Video Software Solutions and cloud and system management products. On October 28, 2018, we completed the sale of the SPVSS. These products include both hardware and software licenses. Our offerings in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control.\n\nIn addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service and support options for our customers, including technical support services and advanced services. Technical support services represent the majority of these offerings which are distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Advanced services are distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time with revenue recognized as services are delivered.\n\n72\n\nThe sales arrangements as discussed above are typically made pursuant to customer purchase orders based on master purchase or partner agreements.

Contract modifications routinely occur to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. In most cases, contract modifications are for goods or services that are not distinct and, therefore, are accounted for as part of the existing contract. Transaction price estimates include additional consideration for submitted contract modifications or claims when we believe there is an enforceable right to the modification or claim, the amount can be reliably estimated, and its realization is reasonably assured. Amounts representing modifications accounted for as part of the existing contract are included in the transaction price and recognized as an adjustment to sales on a cumulative catch-up basis.\n\nIn addition, we are subject to audits of incurred costs related to many of our U.S. government contracts. These audits could produce different results than we have estimated for revenue recognized on our cost-based contracts with the U.S. government; however, our experience has been that our costs are acceptable to the government.\n\nContract Estimates\n\nUse of the cost-to-cost or other similar methods of revenue recognition requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the revenue and cost associated with the design, manufacture and delivery of our products and services. Revisions or adjustments to estimates of the transaction price, estimated costs at completion and estimated profit or loss of a performance obligation are often required as work progresses under a contract, as experience is gained, as facts and circumstances change and as new information is obtained, even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change. In determining the estimated costs at completion, we have to make assumptions regarding labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, estimated increases in wages and prices for materials, performance by our subcontractors, and the availability and timing of funding from our customer, among other variables. Revisions or adjustments to our estimated transaction price and estimated costs at completion may also be required if contract modifications occur. The revisions in contract estimates, if significant, can materially affect our results of operations and cash flows, and in some cases result in liabilities to complete contracts in a loss position. Based upon our history, we believe we have the ability to make reasonable estimates for these items. We have accounting policies and controls in place to address these, as well as other contractual and business arrangements to properly account for long-term contracts, and we continue to monitor and improve such policies, controls, and arrangements. For other information on such policies, controls and arrangements, see our discussion in Item 9A of this Form 10-K.\n\nProducts and services provided under long-term, fixed-price contracts represented approximately 97% of our sales for 2019. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if our underlying circumstances were to change. For example, if underlying assumptions were to change such that our estimated profit rate at completion for all fixed-price contracts accounted for under the cost-to-cost percentage-of-completion method was higher or lower by one percentage point, our 2019 operating income would have increased or decreased by approximately $6.5 million. When adjustments in estimated contract revenues or estimated costs at completion are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized by recording adjustments in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of the changes on current and prior periods using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period the loss is determined.\n\nThe aggregate impact of net changes in contract estimates are presented in the table below (amounts in thousands).\n\nOperating income (loss) Net income (loss) from continuing operations Diluted earnings per share\n\nYears Ended September 30, 2018\n\n2019\n\n$ (2,235) $ (6,986) $ (5,146) (0.19)\n\n(2,351) (0.08)\n\n2017 5,737 3,208 0.12\n\n']","The adjustment of the values in FY18 was in accordance with the cumulative catch-up method of accounting.

Credit Facility\n\nIn November 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the ‘‘2016 Credit Facility’’) with Silicon Valley Bank (‘‘SVB’’) as the lender. The 2016 Credit Facility provided a three-year, $25.0 million revolving credit facility, which included a maximum of $25.0 million letter of credit subfacility. Loan advances under the revolving facility were available of up to the full $25.0 million when the balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities minus outstanding revolving loans and letters of credit equaled or exceeded $50.0 million. If our net cash fell below $50.0 million, loan advances were determined based on a borrowing base equal to a specified percentage of the value of our eligible accounts receivable. Loans bore interest, at our option, at (i) the prime rate reported in The Wall Street Journal, minus 0.50% or (ii) a LIBOR rate determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility, plus 2.50%. Over the term of the 2016 Credit Facility, we paid customary closing fees, commitment fees and letter of credit fees for a facility of this size and type.\n\nIn September 2018, we entered into an amendment with SVB to reduce the unused revolving credit facility fee\n\non the 2016 Credit Facility from 0.4% to 0.3%.\n\nOur obligations under the 2016 Credit Facility were secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property. The 2016 Credit Facility required us to maintain compliance with customary affirmative and negative covenants, including compliance with an adjusted quick ratio of not less than 1.50:1.00, as determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility and restricted our ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions on our capital stock.\n\nOn November 1, 2019, the maturity date, we elected to allow the 2016 Credit Facility to expire without renewal. There were no outstanding loans or advances as of the maturity date.

Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, consisting of net loss of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $26.2 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $16.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $10.0 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an outflow from the changes in accrued liabilities and other of $5.9 million and inventory of $5.6 million, partially offset by an inflow from changes in deferred revenue of $3.2 million.\n\nThe unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and other was driven by an increase in lease liabilities associated with the lease of the San Jose corporate office. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to build up of inventory and timing of shipments, partially offset by increased reserves. The favorable change in deferred revenues was primarily driven by increased bookings.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million, consisting of net loss of $27.6 million which includes payments for our internal investigation costs of $8.6 million, non-cash charges of $25.0 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.9 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $3.1 million, offset primarily by an outflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $6.1 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and inventory of $1.5 million.\n\nThe favorable change in deferred revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the sale of subscription and support. The favorable change in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, increased value added tax accrual due to timing of payments, and an increase in legal fees accrual. The unfavorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections. The unfavorable change in prepaid and other assets was mainly driven by the increase in deferred sales commissions due to higher deferred revenue and higher average commission rate. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to the timing of shipments.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $14.3 million, consisting of a net loss of $10.8 million, a cash decrease resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million and non-cash charges of $26.4 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $17.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance of $1.1 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $12.4 million and deferred revenue of $3.0 million, and an outflow from the change in accrued liabilities of $8.9 million, inventory of $4.7 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and accounts payable of $0.9 million.\n\n']","The net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was $66,235,000.

Volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was flat in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior-year period. This result reflected merchandising changes and price elasticity-related declines in certain brands, as well as isolated production challenges, partially offset by the continued benefit from momentum and innovation successes in the snacks businesses. Price/ mix was flat compared to the prior year as unfavorable mix, coupled with increases in brand building investments with retailers were offset by the impact of higher pricing. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC, which was completed in October 2017, contributed $41.3 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 results included $115.9 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $156.4 million of net sales related to this divested business.\n\nRefrigerated & Frozen net sales for fiscal 2019 were $2.80 billion, an increase of $51.0 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 1% increase in volume compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales volumes was a result of innovation across multiple brands, which was partially offset by the effects of reduced merchandising spend and the impact of a recall during the fourth quarter. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2018, as continued delivery of top-line accretive innovation in several brands was partially offset by brand building investments with retailers. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business, which was completed in February 2018, contributed $25.7 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition.\n\nInternational net sales for fiscal 2019 were $793.4 million, a decrease of $50.1 million, or 6%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 2% increase in volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, a 4% decrease due to foreign exchange rates, and a 2% increase in price/mix, in each case compared to fiscal 2018. The volume and price/ mix increases for fiscal 2019 were driven by growth in the Canadian snacks and frozen businesses. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $3.7 million to International net sales for fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 included $4.1 million of net sales related to our Del Monte® processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada, which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $48.9 million of net sales related to this divested business. In addition, fiscal 2019 and 2018 results included $17.1 million and $24.5 million, respectively, related to our divested Wesson® oil business.\n\nFoodservice net sales for fiscal 2019 were $934.2 million, a decrease of $120.6 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 14% decrease in volume, excluding divestitures. The decline in volume reflected the continued execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy and the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Price/mix increased 5% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in price/mix for fiscal 2019 reflected favorable product and customer mix, the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing, and the execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy. Fiscal 2019 included $34.2 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $53.4 million of net sales related to this divested business. Net sales declined by approximately 7% in fiscal 2019 due to the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility.\n\nPinnacle Foods net sales for fiscal 2019 (reflecting 213 days of Conagra Brands ownership) were $1.73 billion.

The amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations.\n\nPurchase Obligations\n\nPurchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor-consigned inventories. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at June 30, 2019, under these arrangements and others.

In accordance with SAB 118, we finalized the amount of the transition tax during the period ended December 23, 2018. The final amount is $868.4 million.

We pay cash interest on the 2041 Notes at an annual rate of 2.625%, on a semi-annual basis. The 2041 Notes may be converted, under certain circumstances, into our Common Stock.\n\nDuring the quarter-ended June 30, 2019, the market value of our Common Stock was greater than or equal to 130% of the 2041 Notes conversion prices for 20 or more trading days of the 30 consecutive trading days preceding the quarter end. As a result, the 2041 Notes are convertible at the option of the holder and are classified as current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for fiscal year 2019.\n\nOn March 12, 2015, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due March 15, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”) and $500 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due March 15, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”). We pay interest at an annual rate of 2.75% and 3.80%, respectively, on the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes, on a semi-annual basis on March 15 and September 15 of each year.\n\nOn June 7, 2016, we completed a public offering of $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due June 15, 2021, (the “2021 Notes”), together with the 2020 Notes, and 2021 Notes, the “Senior Notes”, and collectively with the Convertible Notes, the “Notes”).

Product revenue increased by 6% and service revenue increased by 2%. Our total revenue reflected growth across each of our geographic segments. Product revenue for the BRICM countries, in the aggregate, experienced 1% product revenue decline, driven by a 16% decrease in product revenue in China and a decrease of 1% in Brazil. These decreases were partially offset by increased product revenue in Mexico, Russia and India of 26%, 6% and 5%, respectively.\n\nIn addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a reduced IT spending environment and reductions in spending by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple performance obligations; the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors. In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment.\n\n', 'Results of Operations\n\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of revenue for certain items in our statements of operations for the periods indicated:\n\n2019\n\nFiscal Years 2018\n\n2017\n\nStatements of Operations: Revenue Cost of revenue Gross profit Operating expenses:\n\n100 % 43 % 57 %\n\n100 % 50 % 50 %\n\nResearch and development Selling, general and administrative\n\nLoss from operations Interest expense Interest income and other expense, net Loss before income taxes Provision for income taxes Net loss\n\n120 % 86 % (149 )% (3 )% 2 % (150 )% 1 % (151 )%\n\n79 % 79 % (108 )% (1 )% 1 % (108 )% 1 % (109 )%\n\nImpact of inflation and product price changes on our revenue and on income was immaterial in 2019, 2018 and 2017.\n\nComparison of Fiscal Years 2019 and 2018\n\nRevenue.

This selected financial data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 15 of this Annual report. Over our last five fiscal years, we have acquired a number of companies, including NetSuite Inc. (NetSuite) in fiscal 2017. The results of our acquired companies have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition and have contributed to our revenues, income, earnings per share and total assets.\n\nAs of and for the Year Ended May 31,\n\n(in millions, except per share amounts) Consolidated Statements of Operations Data: Total revenues Operating income Net income (1) Earnings per share—diluted (1) Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding Cash dividends declared per common share Consolidated Balance Sheets Data: Working capital (2) Total assets (2) Notes payable and other borrowings (3)\n\n$ $ $ $\n\n$\n\n$ $ $\n\n2019\n\n39,506 $ 13,535 $ 11,083 $ 2.97 $\n\n3,732\n\n0.81 $\n\n27,756 $ 108,709 $ 56,167 $\n\n2018 (4)\n\n39,383 $ 13,264 $ 3,587 $ 0.85 $\n\n4,238\n\n0.76 $\n\n57,035 $ 137,851 $ 60,619 $\n\n2017 (4)\n\n37,792 $ 12,913 $ 9,452 $ 2.24 $\n\n4,217\n\n0.64 $\n\n50,995 $ 136,003 $ 57,909 $\n\n2016 (4)\n\n37,047 $ 12,604 $ 8,901 $ 2.07 $\n\n4,305\n\n0.60 $\n\n47,105 $ 112,180 $ 43,855 $\n\n(1)\n\nOur net income and diluted earnings per share were impacted in fiscal 2019 and 2018 by the effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act). The more significant provisions of the Tax Act as applicable to us are described below under “Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017”.\n\n(2)\n\nWorking capital and total assets decreased in fiscal 2019 primarily due to $36.1 billion of cash used for repurchases of our common stock during fiscal 2019 and also due to dividend payments, partially offset by the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our fiscal 2019 net income. Working capital and total assets sequentially increased in nearly all of the fiscal 2015 to 2018 periods presented primarily due to the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income generated during the periods presented and the issuances of long-term senior notes of $10.0 billion in fiscal 2018, and $14.0 billion in fiscal 2017. These working capital and total assets increases were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments in the fiscal 2015 to 2018 periods presented. In addition, our total assets were also affected in all periods presented by the repayments of notes payable and other borrowings as discussed further below.\n\n(3)\n\nOur notes payable and other borrowings, which represented the summation of our notes payable and other borrowings, current, and notes payable and other borrowings, non-current, as reported per our consolidated balance sheets as of the dates listed in the table above, decreased during fiscal 2019 primarily due to repayments of certain short-term borrowings and senior notes. Notes payable and other borrowings increased between fiscal 2015 and 2018 primarily due to the fiscal 2018 issuance of long-term senior notes of $10.0 billion and short-term borrowings of $2.5 billion, the fiscal 2017 issuance of long-term senior notes of $14.0 billion and short-term borrowings of $3.8 billion, and the fiscal 2016 short-term borrowings of $3.8 billion.

Interest income increased due to higher interest rates. Other expense in the year ended December 31, 2018, was driven by foreign currency translation losses mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro. Other income in the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven mainly by foreign currency translation gains due to the depreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro.\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nEffective tax rate\n\n19.9%\n\nThe effective income tax rate in 2018 was 19.9% compared to 64.1% in the prior year. The tax rate in 2018 was favorably impacted by a discrete one-time rate change benefit related to the Tax Act resulting from the election of tax accounting method changes, partially offset by a one-time withholding tax on repatriation of earnings from one of our foreign subsidiaries that was completed during the year to enable the use of tax credits due to expire in 2018. The tax rate in 2017 was unfavorably impacted by the application of the Tax Act, driven by the remeasurement of the net deferred tax assets from 35% to 21% and the one-time mandatory transition tax on the historical earnings of foreign affiliates, which resulted in a net non-cash charge of $18,001.\n\nNet earnings were $46,532 or $1.39 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to earnings of $14,448 or $0.43 per diluted share in the comparable period of 2017.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $100,241 at December 31, 2019, and $100,933 at December 31, 2018, of which $98,309 and $96,762, respectively, were held outside the United States. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $692 was primarily driven by cash generated from operating activities of $64,405 and net proceeds from an increase in borrowings of long-term debt of $49,700, which were offset by the payment for the QTI acquisition of $73,906, capital expenditures of $21,733, treasury stock purchases of $11,746, dividends paid of $5,238, and taxes paid on behalf of equity award participants of $2,657.

The increase in revenue wasprimarily attributable to increases in new customers, including approximately 4,000 new customers added since March 31, 2017, a full year of revenuerelated to new customers added during fiscal 2017 and additional revenue from customers that existed as of March 31, 2017. Revenue for the year endedMarch 31, 2018 compared to the year ended March 31, 2017 was positively impacted by approximately $4.7 million primarily as a result of the weakening ofthe U.S. dollar relative to the South African rand and to a lesser extent the British pound.Cost of revenue Year ended March 31, Period-to-period change 2018 2017 Amount % Change (dollars in thousands) Cost of revenue $69,699 $50,314 $19,385 39% 48', 'Table of Contents\n\nOther income and expense items are summarized in the following table:\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nInterest expense\n\n$\n\n(2,085) $\n\nInterest income\n\n1,826\n\nOther (expense) income\n\n(2,676)\n\nTotal other (expense) income, net\n\n$\n\n(2,935) $\n\nInterest expense decreased in the year ended December 31, 2018, versus the same period in 2017 primarily due to lower debt balances, a reduction in interest related to interest rate swaps, and a one-time charge related to a liability that was settled in 2017. Interest income increased due to higher interest rates. Other expense in the year ended December 31, 2018, was driven by foreign currency translation losses mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro.

The tax rate in 2018 was favorably impacted by a discrete one-time rate change benefit related to the Tax Act resulting from the election of tax accounting method changes, partially offset by a one-time withholding tax on repatriation of earnings from one of our foreign subsidiaries that was completed during the year to enable the use of tax credits due to expire in 2018. The tax rate in 2017 was unfavorably impacted by the application of the Tax Act, driven by the remeasurement of the net deferred tax assets from 35% to 21% and the one-time mandatory transition tax on the historical earnings of foreign affiliates, which resulted in a net non-cash charge of $18,001.\n\nNet earnings were $46,532 or $1.39 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to earnings of $14,448 or $0.43 per diluted share in the comparable period of 2017.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $100,241 at December 31, 2019, and $100,933 at December 31, 2018, of which $98,309 and $96,762, respectively, were held outside the United States.
