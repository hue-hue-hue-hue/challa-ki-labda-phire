The Company classifies these measurements as Level 2.\n\nNote 7. Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nThe carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value because their maturity is less than three months. Management believes the carrying amount of the equity and cost-method investments materially approximated fair value at March 31, 2019 based upon unobservable inputs. The fair values of these investments have been determined as Level 3 fair value measurements. The fair values of the Company's line of credit borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements and approximate carrying value excluding debt issuance costs. Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities, the fair value of the Company's line of credit borrowings at March 31, 2019 approximated the carrying value and are considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described in Note 6. The carrying amount of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of the amounts and are considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nFair Value of Subordinated Convertible Debt, Senior Secured Notes, and Term Loan Facility\n\nThe Company measures the fair value of its senior and junior subordinated convertible debt and senior secured notes for\n\ndisclosure purposes.

The more significant provisions of the Tax Act as applicable to us are described below under “Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017”.\n\n(2)\n\nWorking capital and total assets decreased in fiscal 2019 primarily due to $36.1 billion of cash used for repurchases of our common stock during fiscal 2019 and also due to dividend payments, partially offset by the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our fiscal 2019 net income. Working capital and total assets sequentially increased in nearly all of the fiscal 2015 to 2018 periods presented primarily due to the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income generated during the periods presented and the issuances of long-term senior notes of $10.0 billion in fiscal 2018, and $14.0 billion in fiscal 2017. These working capital and total assets increases were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments in the fiscal 2015 to 2018 periods presented. In addition, our total assets were also affected in all periods presented by the repayments of notes payable and other borrowings as discussed further below.\n\n(3)\n\nOur notes payable and other borrowings, which represented the summation of our notes payable and other borrowings, current, and notes payable and other borrowings, non-current, as reported per our consolidated balance sheets as of the dates listed in the table above, decreased during fiscal 2019 primarily due to repayments of certain short-term borrowings and senior notes. Notes payable and other borrowings increased between fiscal 2015 and 2018 primarily due to the fiscal 2018 issuance of long-term senior notes of $10.0 billion and short-term borrowings of $2.5 billion, the fiscal 2017 issuance of long-term senior notes of $14.0 billion and short-term borrowings of $3.8 billion, and the fiscal 2016 short-term borrowings of $3.8 billion.

The sales cycle, contractual obligations, customer requirements, and go-to-market strategies differ for each of our product categories, resulting in different economic risk profiles for each category.\n\nThe following table presents this disaggregation of revenue (in millions):\n\nYears Ended Revenue:\n\nJuly 27, 2019\n\nJuly 28, 2018\n\nJuly 29, 2017\n\nInfrastructure Platforms . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Total revenue includes SPVSS business revenue of $168 million and $903 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\nInfrastructure Platforms consist of our core networking technologies of switching, routing, wireless, and data center products that are designed to work together to deliver networking capabilities and transport and/or store data. These technologies consist of both hardware and software offerings, including software licenses and software-as-a-service (SaaS), that help our customers build networks, automate, orchestrate, integrate, and digitize data. We are shifting and expanding more of our business to software and subscriptions across our core networking portfolio. Our hardware and perpetual software in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses are multiple performance obligations where the term license is recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.\n\nApplications consists of offerings that utilize the core networking and data center platforms to provide their functions. The products consist primarily of software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS, as well as hardware. Our perpetual software and hardware in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses are multiple performance obligations where the term license is recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.\n\nSecurity primarily includes our network security, cloud and email security, identity and access management, advanced threat protection, and unified threat management products. These products consist of both hardware and software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS. Updates and upgrades for the term software licenses are critical for our software to perform its intended commercial purpose because of the continuous need for our software to secure our customers’ network environments against frequent threats. Therefore, security software licenses are generally represented by a single distinct performance obligation with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.\n\nOther Products primarily include our Service Provider Video Software Solutions and cloud and system management products. On October 28, 2018, we completed the sale of the SPVSS. These products include both hardware and software licenses. Our offerings in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control.\n\nIn addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service and support options for our customers, including technical support services and advanced services. Technical support services represent the majority of these offerings which are distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Advanced services are distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time with revenue recognized as services are delivered.\n\n72\n\nThe sales arrangements as discussed above are typically made pursuant to customer purchase orders based on master purchase or partner agreements. Cash is received based on our standard payment terms which is typically 30 days. We provide financing arrangements to customers for all of our hardware, software and service offerings. Refer to Note 8 for additional information. For these arrangements, cash is typically received over time.\n\n(b) Contract Balances\n\nAccounts receivable, net was $5.5 billion as of July 27, 2019 compared to $5.6 billion as of July 28, 2018.\n\nContract assets consist of unbilled receivables and are recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of scheduled billings to our customers. These amounts are primarily related to software and service arrangements where transfer of control has occurred but we have not yet invoiced. As of July 27, 2019 and July 29, 2018, our contract assets for these unbilled receivables were $860 million and $122 million, respectively, and were included in other current assets and other assets.\n\nContract liabilities consist of deferred revenue.', 'Other non-current assets\n\nOther non-current assets consisted of the following (in thousands):\n\nDecember 31, 2019\n\nDecember 31, 2018\n\nRight of use assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Credit Facility\n\nIn November 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the ‘‘2016 Credit Facility’’) with Silicon Valley Bank (‘‘SVB’’) as the lender. The 2016 Credit Facility provided a three-year, $25.0 million revolving credit facility, which included a maximum of $25.0 million letter of credit subfacility. Loan advances under the revolving facility were available of up to the full $25.0 million when the balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities minus outstanding revolving loans and letters of credit equaled or exceeded $50.0 million. If our net cash fell below $50.0 million, loan advances were determined based on a borrowing base equal to a specified percentage of the value of our eligible accounts receivable. Loans bore interest, at our option, at (i) the prime rate reported in The Wall Street Journal, minus 0.50% or (ii) a LIBOR rate determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility, plus 2.50%. Over the term of the 2016 Credit Facility, we paid customary closing fees, commitment fees and letter of credit fees for a facility of this size and type.\n\nIn September 2018, we entered into an amendment with SVB to reduce the unused revolving credit facility fee\n\non the 2016 Credit Facility from 0.4% to 0.3%.\n\nOur obligations under the 2016 Credit Facility were secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property. The 2016 Credit Facility required us to maintain compliance with customary affirmative and negative covenants, including compliance with an adjusted quick ratio of not less than 1.50:1.00, as determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility and restricted our ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions on our capital stock.\n\nOn November 1, 2019, the maturity date, we elected to allow the 2016 Credit Facility to expire without renewal. There were no outstanding loans or advances as of the maturity date. We currently have no plans for entering into a new borrowing facility.\n\n']","The three dates listed in the table in chronological order are:

The 2016 Credit Facility required us to maintain compliance with customary affirmative and negative covenants, including compliance with an adjusted quick ratio of not less than 1.50:1.00, as determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility and restricted our ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions on our capital stock.\n\nOn November 1, 2019, the maturity date, we elected to allow the 2016 Credit Facility to expire without renewal.

The net increase in the total valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 is primarily related to the increase of a net operating loss carry forward due to a release of a non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefit and the increase of deferred tax assets in sites with existing valuation allowances. The decrease in domestic federal and state tax credits is primarily related to the utilization of tax credits against the one-time transition tax.\n\nAs of August 31, 2019, the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the remaining earnings from its foreign\n\nsubsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not already been recorded.

What does the table represent?,"['D', ""GLOSSARY ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES – continued\n\nEBITDA: TORM defines EBITDA as earnings before financial income and expenses, depreciation, impairment, amortization and taxes. The computation of EBITDA refers to financial income and expenses which the Company deems to be equivalent to “interest” for purposes of presenting EBITDA. Financial expenses consist of interest on borrowings, losses on foreign exchange transactions and bank charges. Financial income consists of interest income and gains on foreign exchange transactions.\n\nEBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by Management and external users of financial statements, such as lenders, to assess TORM's operating performance as well as compliance with the financial covenants and restrictions contained in the Company's financing agreements. TORM believes that EBITDA assists Management and investors by increasing comparability of the Company's performance from period to period. This increased comparability is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects of interest, depreciation, impairment, amortization and taxes. These are items that could be affected by various changing financing methods and capital structure and which may significantly affect profit/(loss) between periods. Including EBITDA as a measure benefits investors in selecting between investment alternatives.\n\nEBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect profit/(loss), and these measures may vary among other companies and not be directly comparable.

These activities were partially offset by higher tax payments, the timing of interest payments and $60 million of proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps in the prior year.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $242 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to lower payments for taxes, integration and restructuring costs and proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps.

The increase was primarily due to $178 million of proceeds received for the dispositions of our commercial cybersecurity and health staff augmentation businesses, $96 million of proceeds received for the sale of real estate properties and $81 million of cash paid in the prior year related to our 2016 acquisition. These activities were partially offset by $94 million of cash paid related to the acquisition of IMX, higher purchases of property, equipment and software and lower proceeds from promissory notes.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $43 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to $81 million of cash paid related to the 2016 acquisition of the IS&GS Business, partially offset by $40 million of proceeds from the settlement of a promissory note.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $2 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to the timing of debt payments and higher stock repurchases, partially offset by $23 million of cash paid related to a tax indemnification in the prior year and the timing of issuances of stock.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $278 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to $250 million of stock repurchases under the ASR program, $167 million of open market stock repurchases and $23 million of cash paid related to a tax indemnification liability.

Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, consisting of net loss of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $26.2 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $16.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $10.0 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an outflow from the changes in accrued liabilities and other of $5.9 million and inventory of $5.6 million, partially offset by an inflow from changes in deferred revenue of $3.2 million.\n\nThe unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and other was driven by an increase in lease liabilities associated with the lease of the San Jose corporate office. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to build up of inventory and timing of shipments, partially offset by increased reserves. The favorable change in deferred revenues was primarily driven by increased bookings.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million, consisting of net loss of $27.6 million which includes payments for our internal investigation costs of $8.6 million, non-cash charges of $25.0 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.9 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $3.1 million, offset primarily by an outflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $6.1 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and inventory of $1.5 million.\n\nThe favorable change in deferred revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the sale of subscription and support. The favorable change in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, increased value added tax accrual due to timing of payments, and an increase in legal fees accrual. The unfavorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections. The unfavorable change in prepaid and other assets was mainly driven by the increase in deferred sales commissions due to higher deferred revenue and higher average commission rate. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to the timing of shipments.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $14.3 million, consisting of a net loss of $10.8 million, a cash decrease resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million and non-cash charges of $26.4 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $17.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance of $1.1 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $12.4 million and deferred revenue of $3.0 million, and an outflow from the change in accrued liabilities of $8.9 million, inventory of $4.7 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and accounts payable of $0.9 million.\n\n']",The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was $224 million compared to fiscal 2018.,$224 million,1.0,0.9999999999666667,0.9999999999666667,0.5,0.9720130439335715

The SIP shareholders are entitled to dividends over the Vesting Period. There are no performance conditions applicable to the vesting of SIP shares.

Options exercised prior to the vesting date relate to those attributable to good leavers as defined by the scheme rules.\n\nPerformance Share Plan The Group operates a Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) for Executive Directors, the Operating Leadership Team and certain key employees. The extent to which awards vest will depend upon the Group’s performance over the three-year period following the award date. Both market based and non-market based performance conditions may be attached to the options, for which an appropriate adjustment is made when calculating the fair value of an option. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire. Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest, unless under exceptional circumstances.\n\nOn 17 August 2018, the Group awarded 452,695 nil cost options under the PSP scheme. For the 2018 awards, the Group’s performance is measured by reference to the growth in Operating profit (75% of the award) and growth in Revenue (25% of the award) over the three-year period April 2018 – March 2021. For previous awards, the Group’s performance had been measured by reference to the cumulative profit measure (Underlying operating profit for 2015 and 2016 awards, and Operating profit for 2017 awards) and total shareholder return relative to the FTSE 250 share index.\n\n', 'The fair value of the 2018 award was determined using a Black-Scholes pricing model. The PSP awards granted prior to 2018 have been valued using the Monte Carlo model for the TSR element and the Black-Scholes model for the Operating profit and Underlying operating profit element. The resulting share-based payments charge is being spread evenly over the period between the grant date and the vesting date.\n\nPSP award holders are entitled to receive dividends accruing between the grant date and the vesting date and this value will be delivered in shares.

The Plan consists of two schemes, the Deferred Annual (‘DAB’) and the Single Incentive Plan Award (‘SIPA’).\n\nDeferred Annual Bonus The Group operates a Deferred Annual scheme (‘DABP’) for Executive Directors and certain key senior executives. Awards under the plan are contingent on the satisfaction of pre-set internal targets relating to financial and operational objectives. Awards have a vesting period of two years from the date of the award (the ‘Vesting Period’) and are potentially forfeitable during that period should the employee leave employment. The DABP awards have been valued using the Black-Scholes method and the resulting share-based payments charge is being spread evenly over the combined Performance Period and Vesting Period of the shares, being three years.\n\nOn 16 June 2018, the Group awarded 71,552 nil cost options under the DABP scheme.

These stock options were valued using a Black-Scholes model, using a volatility rate of 45.7%, a risk-free rate of 2.21%, a strike priceof $36.61 and an expected term of 6.5 years.

The increase was primarily attributable to a $11.8 million increase in payroll and related expenses, primarily consisting of salaries and incentive-based compensation, a $8.7 million increase in ERP integration and technology transition costs, a $4.0 million increase in rent and software costs, and a $2.8 million increase in consulting expenses. Additionally, $2.5 million of the overall increase was attributed to 19 additional days of ownership of our TOKIN subsidiary during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. Partially offsetting these increases was a $1.5 million decrease in legal fees incurred defending anti-trust litigation claims.\n\n42', 'equity-based compensation; (4) adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments or receipts that may represent a reduction or increase in cash available to us; and (5) other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces the usefulness of the metric as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA alongside our other GAAP-based financial performance measures, net loss and our other GAAP financial results.

Adjusted gross margin represents gross profit plus amortization of acquired intangibles and stock-based compensation. Adjusted gross margin is a measure used by management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to generate future operating plans. The exclusion of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis. In the near term, we expect these expenses to continue to negatively impact our gross profit. Adjusted gross margin is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that adjusted gross margin provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.

The decrease is attributable to a decrease of $203.7 million in net cash used in payments for the construction costs of newbuildings and other fixed assets, a net increase of $45.5 million in cash from short-term investments in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period of 2018 and an increase of $0.8 million in cash from interest income.\n\nNet Cash Provided By Financing Activities\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased by $318.0 million, from $368.1 million during\n\nthe year ended December 31, 2018 to $50.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is mainly attributable to an increase of $316.0 million in bank loan repayments, a decrease of $208.4 million in proceeds from the GasLog Partners’ issuance of preference units, a decrease of $60.4 million in proceeds from the GasLog Partners’ common unit offerings, an increase of $46.7 million in payments for NOK bond repurchase at a premium, an increase of $26.6 million in cash used for purchases of treasury shares or common units of GasLog Partners, an increase of $18.5 million in payments of loan issuance costs, an increase of $15.4 million in dividend payments on common and preference shares, an increase of $3.7 million in payments for cross currency swaps’ termination, an increase of $2.6 million in payments for lease liabilities, an increase of $0.8 million in payments for equity-related costs and a decrease of $0.5 million in proceeds from stock option exercise, partially offset by an increase of $381.6 million in proceeds from borrowings.\n\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018\n\nThe following table summarizes our net cash flows from operating, investing and financing\n\nactivities for the years indicated:\n\nYear ended December 31,\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nChange\n\nAmounts in thousands of U.S. dollars Net cash provided by operating activities . . . . . .

The increase was attributable to an increase in total revenues (revenues and net pool allocation) of $103.7 million, partially offset by a decrease of $23.5 million caused by movements in working capital accounts, an increase of $15.3 million in cash paid for interest including the interest paid for finance leases and a net decrease of $4.8 million from the remaining movements.\n\nNet Cash Used In Investing Activities\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $618.4 million, from $74.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $693.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is mainly attributable to an increase of $591.5 million in payments for the construction costs of newbuildings and other fixed assets and a net decrease in cash from short-term investments of $43.0 million in 2018 compared to 2017.

The timing of invoicing to our customers is a negotiated term and thus varies among our subscription contracts. Payment terms are generally billed either monthly or on an annual basis. At any point in the contract term, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice, which constitute backlog. Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, we do not recognize them as revenues, unearned revenues or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements. Given the variability in our contract length, we believe that backlog is not a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.\n\nDeferred Revenue\n\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of invoiced fees for our subscriptions, which we recognize as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. Customers with annual or multi-year contracts may opt for annual invoicing. For these customers, we generally invoice only one annual subscription period in advance. Therefore, our deferred revenue balance does not capture the full contract value of such multi-year contracts. Accordingly, we believe that deferred revenue is not a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize deferred revenue as a key management metric internally.\n\nContractual Obligations\n\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\n\nPayments due by period\n\nUp to 1 year\n\n1 to 3 years\n\n3 to 5 years\n\nMore than 5 years\n\nOperating lease obligations\n\n16,164\n\n19,812\n\n6,551\n\n5,883\n\nFinancing obligations\n\n2,956\n\n5,912\n\n—\n\n—\n\nLong-term debt\n\n—\n\n—\n\n460,000\n\n—\n\nPurchase obligations\n\n55,755\n\n16,220\n\n7,595\n\n17,649\n\nTotal\n\n74,875\n\n41,944\n\n474,146\n\n23,532\n\nPurchase obligations represent an estimate of open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the normal course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of December 31, 2019.

General and administrative expenses for the yearended March 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2017 were negatively impacted by approximately $0.3 million primarily as a result of theweakening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and South African rand. Personnel-related costs increased primarily as a result of salaries and benefitsassociated with increased headcount. Share-based compensation expense increased primarily as a result of share option grants since the prior year.Information technology and facility and material supplies costs increased primarily as a result of increased headcount.Restructuring and Impairment of long-lived assetsIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, upon the exit of our Watertown, Massachusetts corporate office space, we recorded a restructuring charge of $0.8million for remaining non-cancelable rent and estimated operating expenses for the vacated premises, net of sublease rentals, and a non-cash impairmentcharge of $1.7 million primarily related to leasehold improvements.Other income (expense) Year ended March 31, Period-to-period change 2018 2017 Amount % Change (dollars in thousands) Other income (expense): Interest income $1,310 $510 $800 157%Interest expense (598) (268) (330) 123%Foreign exchange (expense) income and other, net (3,439) 6,892 (10,331) nm Total other income (expense), net $(2,727) $7,134 $(9,861) nm nm—not meaningful Other income (expense), net changed $9.9 million in the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the year ended March 31, 2017, which was primarilyattributable to a change of $10.4 million in foreign exchange expense which was primarily attributable to the re-measurement of short-term intercompanybalances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our operating units.

DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS\n\nAs a result of the Rofin acquisition, we have assumed all assets and liabilities of Rofin’s defined benefit plans for the Rofin-Sinar Laser, GmbH (‘‘RSL’’) and Rofin-Sinar Inc. (‘‘RS Inc.’’) employees. The U.S. plan began in fiscal 1995 and is partially funded. Any new employees hired after January 1, 2007, are not eligible for the RS Inc. pension plan. As is the customary practice with German companies, the German pension plan is unfunded. Any new employees hired after 2000 are not eligible for the RSL pension plan. The measurement date of these pension plans is September 30. For these pension plans, actuarial gains and losses are deferred into OCI and amortized over future periods.\n\nEffective January 1, 2012, the RS Inc. defined benefit plan was amended to exclude highly compensated employees, as defined by the Internal Revenue Service, from receiving future years of service under the RS Inc. defined benefit plan. A non-qualified defined benefit plan was created to replace the benefits lost by the employees that were otherwise excluded from the qualified defined benefit plan. Effective August 31, 2018 both the RS Inc. plans were amended to freeze all future compensation benefit accruals.\n\nIn addition, we have defined benefit plans in South Korea, Japan, Spain and Italy, covering all\n\nfull-time employees with at least one year of service, and a defined benefit plan in Germany covering two individuals. As is the customary practice with European and Asian companies, the plans are unfunded, with the exception of the Spanish plan which is partially funded. We have elected to recognize all actuarial gains and losses on these plans immediately, as incurred. The measurement date of these defined benefit plans is September 30.\n\nFor financial reporting purposes, the calculation of net periodic pension costs is based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations, an assumed rate of return on pension assets and an assumed rate of compensation increase for employees covered by the plan. All of these assumptions were based upon management’s judgment, considering all known trends and uncertainties. Actual results that differ from these assumptions would impact future expense recognition and the cash funding requirements of our defined benefit plans.\n\nComponents of net periodic cost are as follows for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\n\nFiscal\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nService cost . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

We deleveraged during the second half of 2019 and remain committed to a target leverage profile consistent with a mid to high single A credit rating within a couple of years.\n\nOn July 9, 2019, we closed the acquisition of Red Hat for cash consideration of $34.8 billion. The transaction was funded through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from debt issuances. In order to reduce this debt and return to target leverage ratios within a couple of years, we suspended our share repurchase program at the time of the Red Hat acquisition closing. In the second half of 2019, we reduced debt levels by $10.1 billion. Refer to note P, “Borrowings,” for additional details of financing this transaction.\n\nThe indenture governing our debt securities and our various credit facilities each contain significant covenants which obligate the company to promptly pay principal and interest, limit the aggregate amount of secured indebtedness and sale and leaseback transactions to 10 percent of IBM’s consolidated net tangible assets, and restrict our ability to merge or consolidate unless certain conditions are met. The credit facilities also include a covenant on our consolidated net interest expense ratio, which cannot be less than 2.20 to 1.0, as well as a cross default provision with respect to other defaulted indebtedness of at least $500 million.\n\nWe are in compliance with all of our significant debt covenants and provide periodic certification to our lenders. The failure to comply with debt covenants could constitute an event of default with respect to our debt to which such provisions apply. If certain events of default were to occur, the principal and interest on the debt to which such event of default applied would become immediately due and payable.\n\nWe do not have “ratings trigger” provisions in our debt covenants or documentation, which would allow the holders to declare an event of default and seek to accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating. Our contractual agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the agreement if IBM’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade. At December 31, 2019, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was $673 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of the company’s outstanding instruments and market conditions. We have no other contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would result in a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity.\n\nIn July 2017, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. Various central bank committees and working groups continue to discuss replacement of benchmark rates, the process for amending existing LIBOR-based contracts, and the potential economic impacts of different alternatives. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred alternative rate for USD LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. We are evaluating the potential impact of the replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, including risk management, internal operational readiness and monitoring the FASB standard-setting process to address financial reporting issues that might arise in connection with transition from LIBOR to a new benchmark rate.\n\nWe prepare our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with applicable accounting standards for cash flow presentation on page 71 and highlight causes and events underlying sources and uses of cash in that format on page 45. For the purpose of running its business, IBM manages, monitors and analyzes cash flows in a different format.\n\nManagement uses free cash flow as a measure to evaluate its operating results, plan share repurchase levels, strategic investments and assess its ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. We define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and net cash from operating activities that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables. Free cash flow guidance is derived using an estimate of profit, working capital and operational cash flows. Since we view Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment which we seek to maximize, it is not considered when formulating guidance for free cash flow. As a result, we do not estimate a GAAP Net Cash from Operations expectation metric.']",The provided information does not contain a definition of ROIC.,as tax-effected operating income before restructuring and other special items divided by average invested capital over a rolling five-quarter period for the fiscal year.,0.0,0.9999999999,0.9999999999,0.0,0.9691604803287386

ADTRAN, Inc. et al., Docket No. 19-cv-09619, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company, two of its current executive officers and one of its former executive officers. The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages on behalf of purported purchasers of ADTRAN securities between February 28, 2019 and October 9, 2019. The lawsuit claims that the defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding, and/or failed to disclose material adverse facts about, the Company’s business, operations and prospects, specifically relating to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, excess and obsolete inventory reserves, financial results and shipments to a Latin American customer. Investors in ADTRAN securities had until December 16, 2019 to move the court to serve as lead plaintiff in this action.\n\nOn December 16, 2019, two purported investors in ADTRAN securities filed motions seeking to be appointed lead plaintiff in the case. On January 6, 2020, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted Defendants’ unopposed request to transfer the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, where the case is now pending as Burbridge v. ADTRAN, Inc. et al., Docket No. 5:20-cv-00050-LCB. On January 27, 2020, the two prospective lead plaintiff movants filed a stipulation among plaintiffs seeking to be appointed as co-lead plaintiffs in the case.\n\nWe disagree with the claims made in the complaint and intend to vigorously defend against this lawsuit.

We work with our customers to look for the best packaging solutions for all our products, that take into account the environmental impact, while keeping our food fresher for longer. We are committed to working with our customers to reducing our use of single-use plastics and partnering with suppliers to find effective alternatives.\n\nWe support the UK Plastics Pact and are committed to meeting its 2025 targets. We will monitor and reduce the amount of plastics used to transport and consume our products, and we aim to develop a circular system whereby plastic is used less and kept out of the environment. Throughout FY19, we have engaged with all key customers and have plans to remove remaining ‘hard to recycle’ packaging as soon as possible.\n\nOver the last six years, we have made good progress in our water consumption per tonne of product, reducing it by 15% over the period. There was also a significant improvement in FY19, and one of the contributing factors to the improvement was the closure of the Evercreech desserts facility which had a higher water intensity than most sites within the business.\n\nWater consumption per tonne of product – UK manufacturing (m3 per tonne)\n\nIn FY19, we saved 18.7 tonnes of plastic by replacing the black plastic trays in a ready meal range with foil.

Competitors in the transmission business consist mainly of a small number of large multinational companies, increasingly joined by smaller, fast-growing manufacturers in emerging coun- tries including China, India and Korea.\n\nSeveral trends are affecting the businesses of the Operating Com- pany. In the power generation business, the ongoing strong growth in demand for power from renewable sources – which come with associated short-term fluctuations in power genera- tion levels – is shifting market demand from fossil baseload gen- eration to more flexible, highly efficient and affordable gas power plants with low emissions, in particular in Europe, Latin America and Asia. A second trend is that the development and execution of large projects increasingly requires financing by the OEM, in- cluding equity participation. For Gas and Power, this role is ful- filled by Financial Services, which can offer customers a range of financing and equity options backed by domain know-how. In general, the markets for the Operating Company are strongly af- fected by changes in national energy regulations, such as support of renewable energy, the security of supply through capacity mar- kets or strategic reserve capacity, carbon pricing and climate change targets, and modernization of energy and electricity mar- kets. Fuel efficiency standards in the U. S. and the European Union are expected to weigh on future demand for fossil transportation fuels in these regions, contrasting with strong growth in transpor- tation-related fuel use in other world regions, particularly in Asia.\n\nIn Oil and Gas, the role of natural gas compared to other fossil fuels is growing from the mid- to long-term perspective, facili- tated by its lower carbon footprint. Furthermore, declining pro- duction from maturing oil and gas fields, or depletion, requires improved recovery technologies as well as additional mechanical and electrical power, necessitating continuous investments. At the same time, oil and gas companies increasingly focus on asset economics and emission footprint, requiring products and solu- tions offering an improved balance of high asset productivity with safety and environmental performance. Generally, our oil and gas business benefits from these major market trends. At the same time, our diversified and global presence across the oil and gas value chain and other industries – each following their own business cycles – offers stable opportunities for our business.\n\nThe transmission business generally benefits from major trends and changes in global electrical power systems, in particular decarbonization, digitalization and global electrification. Decar- bonization is shifting the focus of generation to both central and decentral renewables. This shift increases demand for offshore connectivity and grid stability, requiring environmentally friendly products and systems. The integration of wind power, photo- voltaics, biomass, storage and other intermittent or distributed energy resources into efficient and reliable power networks\n\nincreases grid complexity. Holistic asset transparency to increase efficiency of existing grid assets and performance, enabled by digitalization, is becoming increasingly important. Digitalization involves increased product and system connectivity and provid- ing intelligent solutions for the management of complex energy networks. Connected assets provide value potential for additional services and enhanced asset operation. The continuously grow- ing demand for electricity worldwide requires stable transporta- tion of greener bulk power with minimal losses from the location of generation to different demand load centers, some of which may even be located in other countries.\n\nR & D activities of the power generation and oil and gas busi- nesses concentrate on developing products and solutions for enhancing efficiency and flexibility, and for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in power generation and in the oil and gas indus- try. These products and solutions include turbomachinery – primarily high-performance, low-emission gas turbines for sim- ple-cycle operation or for combined-cycle power plants – and compressor solutions combining electrical, automation, and digitalization offerings for oil and gas as well as process indus- tries. A field of activity is using hydrogen as a renewable fuel in gas turbines. Gas and Power is also intensifying R & D in innova- tive materials, advanced manufacturing methods and plant opti- mization. In the transmission business, R & D activities focus on preparing the portfolio for a deregulated environment in which total cost of ownership is decisive. Innovations accordingly focus on product digitalization, power electronics, software-driven power control, environmentally friendly products and systems, and grid stabilization. The increasing infeed of renewable energy to power grids, with distributed generation on the rise, requires those grids to become more flexible and efficient. The invest- ments of Gas and Power are focused on enhancing productivity through automation and increasing customer proximity via stra- tegic localization of capacity. Investing activities mainly relate to gas turbines and turbine components.\n\nFiscal year\n\n% Change\n\n(in millions of €)\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nActual\n\nComp.\n\nOrders\n\n19,975\n\n18,451\n\n8 %\n\n7 %\n\nRevenue\n\n17,663\n\n18,125\n\n(3) %\n\n(4) %\n\ntherein: service business\n\n8,025\n\n7,756\n\n3 %\n\n2 %\n\nAdjusted EBITA\n\n679\n\n722\n\n(6) %\n\nAdjusted EBITA margin\n\n3.8 %\n\n4.0 %\n\nOrders were up clearly year-over-year, due mainly to higher orders in the new-unit business.

The percentage change is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{FY19} - \text{FY18}}{\text{FY18}} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Percentage Change for Scope 1} = \left( \frac{59,495 - 66,336}{66,336} \right) \times 100 \approx -10.77\%

For Electricity, heat, steam and cooling purchased for own use (Scope 2), emissions decreased from 32,389 tonnes CO2e in FY18 to 27,633 tonnes CO2e in FY19:

\[
\text{Percentage Change for Scope 2} = \left( \frac{27,633 - 32,389}{32,389} \right) \times 100 \approx -14.70\%

If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\nGoodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the cash-generating unit to which it relates is greater than the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use.\n\nFor the year-ended 31 March 2019, the Directors have reviewed the value of goodwill based on internal value in use calculations. The key assumptions for these calculations are discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to billings and direct costs during the period.\n\nThe Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the Directors’ most recent financial forecasts for the following five years. The growth rates for the five-year period are based on Directors’ expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the cash-generating unit, planned growth in market share, industry forecasts, growth in the market and specific regional considerations and are in line with past experience. Discount rates have been estimated based on rates that reflect current market assessments of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital.\n\nThe key assumptions used in the assessments in the year-ended 31 March 2019 are as follows:\n\nAmericas\n\nEMEA\n\nAPJ\n\nLong-term regional growth rate beyond five years\n\n2.5%\n\n1.5%\n\n2.0%\n\nDiscount rate\n\n9.0%\n\n9.0%\n\n10.0%\n\nThe key assumptions used in the assessments in the year-ended 31 March 2018 were as follows:\n\nAmericas\n\nEMEA\n\nAPJ\n\nLong-term regional growth rate beyond five years\n\n2.5%\n\n1.5%\n\n2.0%\n\nDiscount rate\n\n9.5%\n\n9.5%\n\n10.5%\n\nAs at 31 March 2019, there were no indicators of impairment that suggested the carrying amounts of the Group’s long-lived assets are not recoverable. In order to assess the sensitivity in the assumptions made, the Directors have flexed the discount rate upward by thirty per cent of the above rates, and noted that this still did not give any indication of impairment.\n\n153', 'General and administrative expenses in 2019 decreased by $2.7 million, or 20%, as compared to 2018.

The primary driver for this change was the current foreign income tax provision, which was $0.2 million in 2019, as compared to $0.9 million in 2018. In 2019, there was a net benefit of $0.3 million from the reserve for uncertain foreign tax positions primarily due to the close of the statute of limitations on several such positions during the year. This compared to 2018, when there was a $0.4 million net expense related to the reserve for uncertain foreign tax positions. The remaining decrease in the current foreign income tax provision was primarily due to reduced profits earned by our wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries as compared to 2018.\n\n37\n\n%\n\n%\n\n%\n\n%\n\n(87) %\n\n100 %\n\n41 %\n\n', 'CARPENTER TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 were as\n\nfollows:\n\n($ in millions) Goodwill Accumulated impairment losses\n\nTotal goodwill\n\nJune 30, 2017 310.6 $ (47.2) 263.4\n\n$\n\nAcquisition 5.3 $ — 5.3\n\n$\n\nJune 30, 2018 315.9 $ (47.2) 268.7\n\n$\n\nAcquisition 57.7 $ — 57.7\n\n$\n\nJune 30, 2019 373.6 $ (47.2) 326.4\n\n$\n\nSpecialty Alloys Operations Performance Engineered Products\n\nTotal goodwill\n\n$\n\n$\n\n195.5 67.9 263.4\n\n$\n\n$\n\n— $ 5.3 5.3\n\n$\n\n195.5 73.2 268.7\n\n$\n\n$\n\n— $\n\n57.7 57.7\n\n$\n\n195.5 130.9 326.4\n\nOther Intangible Assets, Net\n\nJune 30, 2019\n\nJune 30, 2018\n\n($ in millions)\n\nUseful Life (in Years)\n\nGross Carrying Amount\n\nAccumulated Amortization\n\nNet Carrying Amount\n\nGross Carrying Amount\n\nAccumulated Amortization\n\nNet Carrying Amount\n\nTrademarks and trade names\n\nCustomer relationships\n\nNon-compete agreements\n\nTechnology\n\nPatents\n\nTotal\n\n15 - 30\n\n10 - 15\n\n5\n\n15\n\n14 - 20\n\n$\n\n$\n\n33.5\n\n76.9\n\n0.2\n\n7.3\n\n11.4\n\n129.3\n\n$\n\n$\n\n(24.3) $ (36.0) (0.1) (1.0) (0.7) (62.1) $\n\n9.2\n\n40.9\n\n0.1\n\n6.3\n\n10.7\n\n67.2\n\n$\n\n$\n\n33.5\n\n76.9\n\n0.2\n\n7.3\n\n—\n\n117.9\n\n$\n\n$\n\n(23.2) $ (30.8) (0.1) (0.5) — (54.6) $\n\n10.3\n\n46.1\n\n0.1\n\n6.8\n\n—\n\n63.3\n\nThe Company recorded $7.3 million of amortization expense related to intangible assets during fiscal year\n\n2019, $6.8 million during fiscal year 2018 and $6.8 million during fiscal year 2017.

How does TORM define loan-to-value (LTV)?,"[""GLOSSARY ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES – continued\n\nEBITDA: TORM defines EBITDA as earnings before financial income and expenses, depreciation, impairment, amortization and taxes. The computation of EBITDA refers to financial income and expenses which the Company deems to be equivalent to “interest” for purposes of presenting EBITDA. Financial expenses consist of interest on borrowings, losses on foreign exchange transactions and bank charges. Financial income consists of interest income and gains on foreign exchange transactions.\n\nEBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by Management and external users of financial statements, such as lenders, to assess TORM's operating performance as well as compliance with the financial covenants and restrictions contained in the Company's financing agreements. TORM believes that EBITDA assists Management and investors by increasing comparability of the Company's performance from period to period. This increased comparability is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects of interest, depreciation, impairment, amortization and taxes. These are items that could be affected by various changing financing methods and capital structure and which may significantly affect profit/(loss) between periods. Including EBITDA as a measure benefits investors in selecting between investment alternatives.\n\nEBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect profit/(loss), and these measures may vary among other companies and not be directly comparable. The following table reconciles EBITDA to net profit/ (loss), the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure, for the periods presented:\n\nTORM ANNUAL REPORT 2019\n\nUSDm\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nReconciliation to net profit/(loss)\n\nNet profit/(loss) for the year\n\n166.0\n\n34.8\n\n2.4\n\nTax\n\n0.8\n\n1.6\n\n0.8\n\nFinancial expenses\n\n41.9\n\n39.3\n\n40.6\n\nFinancial income\n\n2.8\n\n3.3\n\n4.3\n\nDepreciation\n\n110.1\n\n114.5\n\n114.5\n\nImpairment (reversal)/losses on tangible assets\n\n114.0\n\n3.2\n\n3.6\n\nEBITDA\n\n202.0\n\n120.5\n\n157.6\n\nLoan-to-value (LTV): TORM defines Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio as Vessel values divided by net borrowings on the vessels.\n\nLTV describes the net debt ratio on the vessel, and is used by TORM to describe the financial situation, the liquidity risk as well as to express the future possibilities to raise new capital by new loan facilities.\n\nUSDm\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nVessel values including newbuildings (broker values)\n\n1,801.5\n\n1,675.1\n\n1,661.1\n\nTotal (value)\n\n1,801.5\n\n1,675.1\n\n1,661.1\n\nBorrowings\n\n863.4\n\n754.7\n\n753.9\n\nHereof debt regarding Land and buildings & Other plant\n\nand operating equipment\n\n8.7\n\n\n\n\n\nCommitted CAPEX on newbuildings\n\n51.2\n\n258.0\n\n306.9\n\nLoans receivables\n\n4.6\n\n\n\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash\n\n72.5\n\n127.4\n\n134.2\n\nTotal (loan)\n\n828.8\n\n885.3\n\n926.6\n\nLoan-to-value (LTV) ratio\n\n46.0%\n\n52.9%\n\n55.8%\n\nGLOSSARY\n\n164"", ' The reference pricing for political and commercial risk, on which the tool is based, is reviewed using information from Export Credit Agencies and prevailing pricing in the bank loan and bond markets for structured financed deals.

Volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was flat in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior-year period. This result reflected merchandising changes and price elasticity-related declines in certain brands, as well as isolated production challenges, partially offset by the continued benefit from momentum and innovation successes in the snacks businesses. Price/ mix was flat compared to the prior year as unfavorable mix, coupled with increases in brand building investments with retailers were offset by the impact of higher pricing. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC, which was completed in October 2017, contributed $41.3 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 results included $115.9 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $156.4 million of net sales related to this divested business.\n\nRefrigerated & Frozen net sales for fiscal 2019 were $2.80 billion, an increase of $51.0 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 1% increase in volume compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales volumes was a result of innovation across multiple brands, which was partially offset by the effects of reduced merchandising spend and the impact of a recall during the fourth quarter. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2018, as continued delivery of top-line accretive innovation in several brands was partially offset by brand building investments with retailers. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business, which was completed in February 2018, contributed $25.7 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition.\n\nInternational net sales for fiscal 2019 were $793.4 million, a decrease of $50.1 million, or 6%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 2% increase in volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, a 4% decrease due to foreign exchange rates, and a 2% increase in price/mix, in each case compared to fiscal 2018. The volume and price/ mix increases for fiscal 2019 were driven by growth in the Canadian snacks and frozen businesses. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $3.7 million to International net sales for fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 included $4.1 million of net sales related to our Del Monte® processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada, which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $48.9 million of net sales related to this divested business. In addition, fiscal 2019 and 2018 results included $17.1 million and $24.5 million, respectively, related to our divested Wesson® oil business.\n\nFoodservice net sales for fiscal 2019 were $934.2 million, a decrease of $120.6 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 14% decrease in volume, excluding divestitures. The decline in volume reflected the continued execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy and the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Price/mix increased 5% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in price/mix for fiscal 2019 reflected favorable product and customer mix, the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing, and the execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy. Fiscal 2019 included $34.2 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $53.4 million of net sales related to this divested business. Net sales declined by approximately 7% in fiscal 2019 due to the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility.\n\nPinnacle Foods net sales for fiscal 2019 (reflecting 213 days of Conagra Brands ownership) were $1.73 billion.

Net voyage revenues and TCE rates are widely used by investors and analysts in the tanker shipping industry for comparing the financialperformance of companies and for preparing industry averages. We believe that our method of calculating net voyage revenue is consistent with industry standards. The table belowreconciles our net voyage revenues to voyage revenues. Years Ended December 31, All figures in USD ‘000, except TCE rate per day 2019 2018 Variance Voyage Revenue 317,220 289,016 9.8%Less Voyage expenses (141,770) (165,012) (14.1%)Net Voyage Revenue 175,450 124,004 41.5%Vessel Calendar Days (1) 8,395 9,747 (13.9%)Less off-hire days 293 277 5.8%Total TCE days 8,102 9,470 (14.4%)TCE Rate per day (2) $21,655 $13,095 65.4%)Total Days for vessel operating expenses 8,395 9,747 (13.9%)(1)Vessel Calendar Days is the total number of days the vessels were in our fleet.(2)Time Charter Equivalent (“TCE”) Rate, results from Net Voyage Revenue divided by total TCE days.The change in Voyage revenue is due to two main factors:i)The number of TCE daysii)The change in the TCE rate achieved.With regards to i), the decrease in vessel calendar days is mainly due to the disposal of ten vessels in 2018, offset by three 2018 Newbuildings delivered in the latter part of 2018.43\n\nWith regards to ii), the TCE rate increased by $8,560, or 65.4%. The indicative rates presented by Clarksons Shipping increased by 91.7% for the twelve months of 2019compared to the same twelve months in 2018 to $31,560 from $16,466, respectively. The rates presented by Clarksons Shipping were significantly influenced by the spike in the Suezmaxtanker rates in the fourth quarter of both 2019 and 2018. Our average TCE was also positively impacted by the increased tanker rates towards the end of 2019, but not to the same extentas the rates reported by Clarksons Shipping. We expect this spike to materialize to a larger extent in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the rates reported by Clarksons Shipping.As a result of i) and ii) net voyage revenues increased by 41.5% from $124.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to $175.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.Voyage expenses decreased to $141.8 million from $165.0 million, or 14.1%. The decrease in voyage expenses was primarily due to a decrease in vessel calendar days asdiscussed above.Vessel operating expenses decreased by $14.4 million, or 17.9%, from $80.4 million in 2018 to $66.0 million in 2019. This was primarily due to the decrease in our fleet as discussedabove. In cooperation with our technical managers we maintain our focus on keeping the fleet in top technical condition whilst keeping costs low.No impairment loss on vessels has been recorded in 2019 compared to a loss of $2.2 million recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018.General and administrative expenses increased $0.7 million, or 5.9%, from $12.7 million in 2018 to $13.5 million in 2019.Depreciation expenses increased by $3.3 million, or 5.4%, from $60.7 million in 2018 to $64.0 million in 2019. The increase is primarily due to the full-year effect of the threevessels added to the fleet in the latter part of 2018.Interest expenses increased by $3.8 million, or 11.1%, from $34.5 million in 2018 to $38.4 million in 2019. The increase is mainly due to the full year-effect of the loans associatedwith the three vessels added to the fleet in latter part of 2018 and a non-cash expense of about $1.7 million related to the remaining borrowing cost under the Credit Facility that wasrepaid on February 12, 2019.Other financial expenses decreased by $10.6, or 71.4%, from $14.8 million in 2018 to $4.2 million in 2019 mainly due an expense related to fair value change of $3.2 million forInvestment Securities, offset by the cancellation of the Backstop facility in 2018 and expense of the associated fees of $13.4 million.Please see Item 5.

The majority of our shell eggs are sold at independently quoted wholesale market prices for shell eggs or formulas related to our costs of production which include the cost of corn and soybean meal. The following table shows our net income (loss), gross profit, net average shell egg selling price, the average Urner Barry wholesale large shell egg prices in the southeast region, and feed cost per dozen produced for each of our three most recent fiscal years.\n\nFiscal Year ended\n\nJune 1, 2019\n\nJune 2, 2018\n\nJune 3, 2017\n\nNet income (loss) attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. - (in thousands) Gross profit (in thousands) Net average shell egg selling price (rounded) Average Urner Barry Spot Egg Market Quotations 1 Feed cost per dozen produced\n\n$\n\n54,229 $ 222,859 1.27 1.23 0.415\n\n125,932 $ 361,046 1.40 1.49 0.394\n\n(74,278) 45,550 1.01 0.85 0.399\n\n1- Average Thursday price for the large market (i.e. generic shell eggs) in the southeastern region\n\nThe shell egg industry has historically been subject to periods of high profitability followed by periods of significant loss. The periods of high profitability have often reflected increased consumer demand relative to supply while the periods of significant loss have often reflected excess supply for the then prevailing consumer demand. Historically, demand for shell eggs increases in line with overall population growth. As reflected above, our operating results fluctuate with changes in the spot egg market quote and feed costs. The net average shell egg selling price is the blended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs, including non-graded shell egg sales, breaking stock and undergrades. In fiscal 2017, our net average selling price and dozens sold decreased over the previous fiscal year primarily due to the oversupply of eggs resulting from the repopulation of the national flock of laying hens to levels exceeding the flock size prior to the avian influenza outbreak in 2015, along with a reduced demand for egg products. In fiscal 2018, strong demand resulted in an increase in our average selling price and dozens sold, and feed costs decreased over prior years. Fiscal 2019 saw an increasing U.S. flock size result in oversupply of eggs, particularly in the last half of the fiscal year. This resulted in decreased gross profit and net income for fiscal 2019.\n\n24\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFiscal Year Ended June 1, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 2, 2018\n\nNET SALES\n\nNet sales for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019 were $1,361.2 million, a decrease of $141.7 million, or 9.4%, from net sales of $1,502.9 million for fiscal 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower selling prices for non-specialty eggs in fiscal 2019 due to the oversupply of eggs, particularly in the last half of the fiscal year, contrasted with fiscal 2018 in which we experienced strong demand resulting in higher prices for non-specialty eggs.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, shell egg sales made up approximately 97% of our net sales. Total dozens sold in fiscal 2019 were 1,038.9 million, an increase of 1.2 million dozen, or 0.1%, compared to 1,037.7 million sold in fiscal 2018 resulting in an increase in net sales of $1.7 million for fiscal 2019 compared with the prior year.\n\nNet average selling price of shell eggs decreased from $1.397 per dozen for fiscal 2018 to $1.265 per dozen for fiscal 2019, a decrease of $0.132 per dozen, or 9.4%, primarily reflecting an abundance of eggs in the market. The decrease in sales price in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2018 resulted in a corresponding decrease in net sales of approximately $137.1 million. Our operating results are significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices, which are outside of our control. Small changes in production or demand levels can have a large effect on shell egg prices.\n\nEgg products accounted for approximately 3% of our net sales. These revenues were $41.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019 compared with $43.5 million for the fiscal 2018.\n\nThe table below represents an analysis of our non-specialty and specialty, as well as co-pack specialty, shell egg sales.

In periods where the Company estimates that the cost to grow live birds in inventory to a marketable age and then process and distribute those birds will be lower in the aggregate than the anticipated sales proceeds, the Company values the broiler inventories on hand at cost and accumulates costs as the birds are grown to a marketable age subsequent to the balance sheet date. In periods where the Company estimates that the cost to grow live birds in inventory to a marketable age and then process and distribute those birds will be higher in the aggregate than the anticipated sales proceeds, the Company will make an adjustment to lower the value of live birds in inventory to the net realizable value. The significant judgments that management makes in order to assess the net realizable value of its broiler inventory include estimating future selling prices of finished products and the related cost of sales to complete. The Company recorded a charge of $2.8 million at October 31, 2019 and of $9.6 million at October 31, 2018 to reduce the values of live broiler inventories on hand at those dates from cost to net realizable value.\n\nThe increases in feed, eggs and other, processed poultry and packaging materials inventories are also attributable to an increase in the inventory volume at the Tyler, Texas facility.\n\nThe increase in prepared chicken inventory is attributable to the mix of the different finished products in inventory at October 31, 2019, as compared to October 31, 2018, as well as an increase in production volume at the Company's prepared chicken facility in Flowood, Mississippi. During fiscal 2019, the facility processed approximately 129.1 million pounds of prepared chicken products, as compared to approximately 107.6 million pounds during fiscal 2018. Approximately 1.2 million pounds of that increase was in inventory at October 31, 2019, representing an approximately 12% increase in inventory volume.\n\n""]","The net average shell egg selling price is the blended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs, including non-graded shell egg sales, breaking stock, and undergrades.

In fiscal year 2018, the Company recorded an income tax benefit from continuing operations of $597,000.

This non-cash exchange was completed in December 2017. As a result, we received $414 million of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and recorded a pre-tax gain of $143 million in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\nDuring 2018, we entered into and completed various wireless license transactions, including the purchase of Straight Path Communications Inc. (Straight Path) and NextLink Wireless LLC (NextLink).\n\nDuring 2019, the FCC completed two millimeter wave spectrum license auctions. Verizon participated in these auctions and was the high bidder on 9 and 1,066 licenses, respectively, in the 24 Gigahertz (GHz) and 28 GHz bands. We submitted an application to the FCC and paid cash of approximately $521 million for the licenses. We received the licenses during the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\nDuring 2019, we entered into and completed various other wireless license acquisitions for an insignificant amount of cash consideration.\n\nIn December 2019, the FCC incentive auction for spectrum licenses in the upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz bands commenced. As an incumbent licensee, Verizon received vouchers related to our existing 39 GHz licenses. These vouchers can be converted into cash, the amount of which will not be known until the conclusion of the auction, or applied toward the purchase price of spectrum in the auction. At the conclusion of the auction, all existing licenses will be cancelled and new reconfigured licenses or cash will be distributed depending on the results of the auction. Due to the FCC’s rules restricting communications regarding the auction, we will not disclose our financial plans for the auction during the quiet period for this auction unless legally required. In addition, as of this time, until the completion of the auction process, we cannot determine the resulting financial outcome, including a potential gain or loss. Such gain or loss, if any, may be material.\n\nAcquisition of AOL Inc.\n\nIn May 2015, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with AOL Inc. (AOL) pursuant to which we commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of AOL at a price of $50.00 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.\n\nOn June 23, 2015, we completed the tender offer and merger, and AOL became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the closing of these transactions was approximately $3.8 billion.

The Company has determined that credit risk largely depends on both the risk in the country where the customer resides (e.g. ability to make cross border payments) as well as the payment pattern of the customer. There- fore, expected credit losses (ECLs) are calculated using a provision matrix that specifies a fixed rate depending both on the number of days past due and the country risk rating. The country risk ratings depends on the ratings used by all Export Credit Agencies within the OECD. The rates defined in the provision matrix are based on historical loss patterns for that grouping of customers. These rates are adjusted for current conditions as well as management expec- tations for changes to political risks and payment patterns in the future. The provision rates are higher on high risk countries compared to low risk countries and also higher on amounts that remain unpaid for longer periods of time. There were no significant changes to the model during the year.\n\nTrade receivables and contract assets together amounted to SEK 55,240 (64,350) million as of December 31, 2019. Provisions for expected credit losses on trade receivables and contract assets amounted to SEK 2,983 (4,123) million as of December 31, 2019. The allowance decreased in 2019 due to improvement in cash collection resulting in significant reduction of total past due invoices. The Company’s write-offs have historically been low. During the year SEK 382 (890) million were written off due to the Company having no reasonable expectation of collection. Of these write-offs, SEK 0 (61) million are still subject to enforcement.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, the total amount payable to the Company under customer finance credits was SEK 5,924 (4,247) million. The carrying value of these assets was SEK 3,756 (2,883) million as of December 31, 2019, which represents the maximum exposure to credit risk on these assets. Customer finance is arranged for infrastructure projects in different geographic markets. As of December 31, 2019, there were a total of 80 (94) customer finance arrangements originated by or guaranteed by the Company. The five largest facilities represented 69% (62%) of the customer finance exposure in 2019. As of December 31, 2019, Middle East and Africa made up 49% (57%) of the oustanding exposure while South East Asia, Oceania and India made up 29% (15%). As of December 31, 2019, the Company also had unutilized customer finance commitments of SEK 25,854 (30,270) million.\n\nSecurity arrangements for customer finance facilities may include pledges of equipment, pledges of certain assets belonging to the borrower and pledges of shares in the operating company. If available, third-party risk coverage is, as a rule, arranged. “Third-party risk coverage” means that a financial payment guarantee covering the credit risk has been issued by a bank, an export credit agency or an insurance company. All such institutions have been rated at least investment grade. A credit risk transfer under a sub-participation arrange- ment with a bank can also be arranged. In this case the entire credit risk and the funding is taken care of by the bank for the part that they cover.\n\nInformation about financial guarantees related to customer finance is\n\nincluded in note D2, “Contingent liabilities.”\n\nThe table below summarizes the Company’s outstanding customer finance\n\nas of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\nMovements in allowances for impairment of trade receivables and contract assets\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nOutstanding customer finance credit risk exposure 1)\n\nOpening balance Decrease (–)/increase (+) in allowance Write-offs Translation difference Closing balance 1)\n\n1) Of which SEK 0 (15) million relates to contract assets.\n\n4,123 –737 –382 –21\n\n2,983\n\n4,575 420 –890 18\n\n4,123\n\nFair value of customer finance credits Financial guarantees for third-parties Accrued interest\n\nMaximum exposure to credit risk Less third-party risk coverage\n\n2019\n\n3,756 24 14\n\n3,794 –309\n\n2018\n\n2,883 42 21\n\n2,946 –331\n\nThe Company’s risk exposure, less third-party risk coverage\n\n3,485\n\n2,615\n\nThe distribution of trade receivables and contract assets closely follows the distribution of the Company’s sales, see note B1, “Segment information.” The ten largest customers represented 49% (53%) of the total trade receivables and contract assets in 2019.\n\nAging analysis of gross values by risk category at December 31, 2019\n\nDays past due\n\n1–90\n\n91–180\n\n181–360\n\n>360\n\nCountry risk: Low Country risk: Medium Country risk: High\n\n1,347 891 583\n\n125 725 365\n\n127 600 217\n\n313 819 1,315\n\nTotal past due\n\n2,821\n\n1,215\n\n944\n\n2,447\n\nCustomer finance credit risk All major commitments to finance customers are made only after approval in accordance with the work procedure for the Board of Directors and according to the established credit approval process.\n\nTotal\n\n1,912 3,035 2,480\n\n7,427\n\n1) This table has been adjusted to show the maximum exposure to credit risk.\n\nFair value assessment of customer finance credits Customer finance risk exposures are held at fair value and are classified as Level 3 on the fair value hierarchy. The Credit Asset Management Team within Ericsson Credit AB, reporting to Head of Group Treasury and Customer Finance, has established a process with respect to measurement of fair values. The quarterly credit review uses an internal model to determine a commercial rating for each credit and for calculation of the fair value. The model is based on exter- nal credit rating, political/country rating and bank pricing. Regular monitoring of customer behavior is also a part of the internal assessment. Revaluation of customer finance amounted to a net negative impact in the income statement of SEK 804 (1,073) million in 2019, of which SEK 804 (1,073) million is related to credits held as of December 31, 2019. This effect is presented within selling and administrative expenses and was mainly related to India and the Middle East, especially Iran and Iraq.\n\nPrior to the approval of new facilities reported as customer finance, an internal credit risk assessment is conducted in order to assess the credit rating of each transaction for political and commercial risk. The credit risk analysis is made by using an assessment tool, where the political risk rating is identical to the rating used by all Export Credit Agencies within the OECD. The commercial risk is assessed by analyzing a large number of parameters, which may affect the level of the future commercial credit risk exposure. The output from the assessment tool for the credit rating also includes an internal pricing of the risk. This is expressed as a risk margin per annum over funding cost.', 'NOTE 6—CONTRACT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\n\nContract assets include unbilled amounts typically resulting from sales under contracts when the percentage-of- completion cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition is utilized and revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer.

There were no significant impairment losses related to our contract assets during the twelve months ended September 30, 2019.\n\nContract liabilities decreased $24.0 million during the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, due to revenue recognition in excess of payments received on these performance obligations. During the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2019, we recognized $62.4 million of our contract liabilities at October 1, 2018 as revenue.

As of December 31, 2019, and 2018, we recorded deferred tax assets related to certain U.S. state and non-U.S. income tax loss carryforwards of $4,724 and $4,647, respectively, and U.S. and non- U.S. tax credits of $15,964 and $16,909, respectively. The deferred tax assets expire in various years primarily between 2021 and 2039.\n\nGenerally, we assess if it is more-likely-than-not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized during the available carry-forward periods. As a result, we have determined that valuation allowances of $8,011 and $8,274 should be provided for certain deferred tax assets at December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the valuation allowances relate to certain U.S. state and non-U.S. loss carry-forwards and certain U.S. state tax credits that management does not anticipate will be utilized.\n\nNo valuation allowance was recorded in 2019 against the U.S. federal foreign tax credit carryforwards of $5,785, which expire in varying amounts between 2023 and 2029 as well as the research and development tax credits of $7,495, which expire in varying amounts between 2021 and 2039. We assessed the anticipated realization of those tax credits utilizing future taxable income projections. Based on those projections, management believes it is more-likely-than-not that we will realize the benefits of these credit carryforwards.\n\nThe following table reconciles taxes at the U.S. federal statutory rate to the effective income tax rate:\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nTaxes at the U.S. statutory rate\n\n21.0 %\n\n21.0 %\n\nState income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit\n\n0.4 %\n\n1.2 %\n\nNon-U.S. earnings taxed at rates different than the U.S. statutory rate\n\n1.3 %\n\n0.8 %\n\nForeign source earnings, net of associated foreign tax credits\n\n0.3 %\n\n4.1 %\n\nBenefit of tax credits\n\n(1.5)%\n\n(0.9)%\n\nNon-deductible expenses\n\n4.1 %\n\n1.3 %\n\nStock compensation - excess tax benefits\n\n(1.1)%\n\n(0.9)%\n\nAdjustment to valuation allowances\n\n(0.4)%\n\n(0.6)%\n\nOther changes in tax laws and rates\n\n0.1 %\n\n(6.1)%\n\nChange in unrecognized tax benefits\n\n3.3 %\n\n(1.7)%\n\nImpacts of unremitted foreign earnings\n\n1.3 %\n\n1.1 %\n\nImpacts related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\n\n— %\n\n(0.6)%\n\nOther\n\n(0.7)%\n\n1.2 %\n\nEffective income tax rate\n\n28.1 %\n\n19.9 %\n\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.

We calculated our best estimate of the impact of the Act in our 2017 year-end income tax provision in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which was issued to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed to finalize the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act. Additional work to complete a more detailed analysis of historical foreign earnings, as well as the full impact relating to the write-down of deferred tax assets, was completed in the third quarter of 2018 and resulted in a tax benefit of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, non-current deferred taxes related to our investments and our defined benefit pension plan reflect deferred taxes on the net unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments and deferred taxes on unrealized losses in our pension plan.

During fiscal 2019, tax loss and carryforwards increased primarily as a result of a $2,891 million (tax effected) net write-down of investments in subsidiaries in certain jurisdictions,\n\n65', 'RiceBran Technologies Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established, when necessary, to reduce that deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets can be affected by, among other things, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the length of statutory carryforward periods, our experience with utilizing operating losses and tax credit carryforwards by jurisdiction, and tax planning alternatives that may be available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that may be different from current estimates of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities may result in income tax benefits being recognized in the period when it is determined that the liabilities are no longer necessary.\n\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions, if any, in selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\nFair Value – Fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Certain assets and liabilities may be presented in the financial statements at fair value. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis may include property and equipment.\n\nWe assess the inputs used to measure fair value using a three-tier hierarchy based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market:\n\nLevel 1 – inputs include quoted prices for identical instruments and are the most observable. ● Level 2 – inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and observable inputs such as interest rates, currency exchange rates and yield curves.\n\nLevel 3 – inputs are not observable in the market and include management’s judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\n\nFor instruments measured using Level 3 inputs, a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances is disclosed.\n\nNOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS\n\nMGI\n\nOn April 4, 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets comprising the business of MGI Grain Processing, LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company, now conducting business as MGI Grain Incorporated (MGI) for an aggregate purchase price of $3.8 million. The purchase price included $0.3 million deposited in an escrow account at closing which was subsequently released to the sellers in June 2019. MGI owns and operates a grain mill and processing facility in East Grand Forks, Minnesota. We acquired MGI as part of our strategy to expand our product portfolio. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. The results of MGI’s operations are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning April 4, 2019. In 2019, we incurred $0.1 million of MGI acquisition-related costs which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n31\n\nRiceBran Technologies Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe purchase price for MGI was subject to adjustment if the estimated closing working capital with respect to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed was different than the actual closing working capital, as defined in the purchase agreement. The seller of MGI paid a working capital adjustment of $18 thousand in 2019. The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation, the consideration transferred to acquire MGI and the amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in thousands).\n\nCash Working capital adjustment to purchase price Total fair value of consideration transferred Accounts receivable Inventories Deposits and other current assets Property and equipment Customer relationship Other finite-lived intangible assets Accounts payable Finance lease liabilities Net recognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed Goodwill\n\nEstimated at June 30, 2019 $ 3,795 (38) 3,757 591 149 4 1,560 930 35 (219) (18) 3,032 $ 725\n\nAdjustments $ - 20 20 - - 8 - - - - - 8 $ 12\n\nFinal as of December 31, 2019 $ 3,795 (18) 3,777 591 149 12 1,560 930 35 (219) (18) 3,040 $ 737\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, our appraiser finalized certain fair value calculations and we completed our review of the calculations. The fair value of MGI’s trade receivables at acquisition, equaled the gross amount of trade receivables. The fair value of the customer relationship intangible at acquisition was estimated using an income approach based on expected future cash flows. As discussed in Note 9, we are amortizing the customer relationship intangible to expense over the 15-year period of expected future economic benefit, in proportion to the discounted expected future cash flows used to estimate the value of the intangible at acquisition. Goodwill primarily was attributed to intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition and synergies generated by MGI when combined with our existing operations. The $0.7 million allocated to goodwill is deductible for tax purposes over the next fifteen years.\n\nOur revenues for 2019 include $1.9 million related to the acquired MGI business. Our net loss for 2019 includes $0.3 million of net loss from the acquired MGI business.

We acquired the business as part of our strategy to vertically integrate in order to leverage our proprietary technologies for producing SRB and derivative products. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. The results of Golden Ridge’s operations are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning November 28, 2018.

Interest income increased due to higher interest rates. Other expense in the year ended December 31, 2018, was driven by foreign currency translation losses mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro.

The tax rate in 2018 was favorably impacted by a discrete one-time rate change benefit related to the Tax Act resulting from the election of tax accounting method changes, partially offset by a one-time withholding tax on repatriation of earnings from one of our foreign subsidiaries that was completed during the year to enable the use of tax credits due to expire in 2018. The tax rate in 2017 was unfavorably impacted by the application of the Tax Act, driven by the remeasurement of the net deferred tax assets from 35% to 21% and the one-time mandatory transition tax on the historical earnings of foreign affiliates, which resulted in a net non-cash charge of $18,001.\n\nNet earnings were $46,532 or $1.39 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to earnings of $14,448 or $0.43 per diluted share in the comparable period of 2017.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $100,241 at December 31, 2019, and $100,933 at December 31, 2018, of which $98,309 and $96,762, respectively, were held outside the United States. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $692 was primarily driven by cash generated from operating activities of $64,405 and net proceeds from an increase in borrowings of long-term debt of $49,700, which were offset by the payment for the QTI acquisition of $73,906, capital expenditures of $21,733, treasury stock purchases of $11,746, dividends paid of $5,238, and taxes paid on behalf of equity award participants of $2,657. Total debt as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, was $99,700 and $50,000, respectively.

In conjunction with the changes to reporting units, we reassigned goodwill between CGD and CMS based on their relative fair values on October 1, 2017.\n\nIn July 2017, we acquired Deltenna, a wireless infrastructure company specializing in the design and delivery of radio and antenna communication solutions. Deltenna’s operations were included in our CGD reporting unit upon its acquisition. On April 1, 2019, we reorganized our reporting structure to include Deltenna in our CMS reporting unit and reassigned $3.4 million of goodwill from CGD to CMS based upon its relative fair value. Since its acquisition, Deltenna’s sales, operating results, and cash flows have not been significant to our consolidated results. As such, reportable segment information has not been restated for this change in the composition of our reportable segments.\n\nWe complete our annual goodwill impairment test each year as of July 1 separately for our CTS, CGD and CMS reporting units.\n\nThe test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process. The first step of the test is performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including recorded goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment, if any, by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount. Any resulting impairment determined would be recorded in the current period.\n\nFor our 2019 impairment test, the estimated fair value of all three of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts. As such, there was no impairment of goodwill in 2019.\n\nSignificant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that are used in our impairment analysis. The estimates we used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business. Although we believe our underlying assumptions supporting these assessments are reasonable, if our forecasted sales and margin growth rates, timing of growth, or the discount rate vary from our forecasts, we may be required to perform interim analyses in fiscal 2020 that could expose us to material impairment charges in the future.\n\n107\n\nTotal\n\n', '80 ADTRAN 2019 Annual Report', '4,317']",Deltenna is a wireless infrastructure company specializing in the design and delivery of radio and antenna communication solutions.,a wireless infrastructure company specializing in the design and delivery of radio and antenna communication solutions,1.0,0.9999999999,0.9999999999,1.0,0.9397905413971919

Corporation tax losses are not recognised where future recoverability is uncertain.\n\nThe adjustments to prior periods of £1.7m (2017/18: £(8.1m)) relate mainly to the adjustment of prior period losses and capital allowances which have been revised following submission of tax returns.\n\nDeferred tax Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences using the tax rate appropriate to the jurisdiction in which the asset/(liability) arises and the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled. In all cases this is 17.0% (2017/18: 17.0%).\n\nAt 1 April 2018/2 April 2017 Credited/(charged) to the statement of profit or loss Charged to other comprehensive income Charged to equity At 30 March 2019/31 March 2018\n\n2018/19 £m (12.1) 7.8 (9.1) (0.1) (13.5)\n\n2017/18 £m 32.4 (14.5) (29.7) (0.3) (12.1)\n\nThe Group has not recognised £3.0m of deferred tax assets (2017/18: £2.2m not recognised) relating to UK corporation tax losses. In addition the Group has not recognised a tax asset of £34.8m (2017/18: £34.8m) relating to ACT and £41.3m (2017/18: £42.1m) relating to capital losses. Under current legislation these can generally be carried forward indefinitely.\n\n89', '137 Vodafone Group Plc\n\nAnnual Report 2019\n\n6. Taxation\n\nThis note explains how our Group tax charge arises. The deferred tax section of the note also provides information on our expected future tax charges and sets out the tax assets held across the Group together with our view on whether or not we expect to be able to make use of these in the future.\n\nAccounting policies Income tax expense represents the sum of the current and deferred taxes.\n\nCurrent tax payable or recoverable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because some items of income or expense are taxable or deductible in different years or may never be taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.\n\nThe Group recognises provisions for uncertain tax positions when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and management judge that it is probable that there will be a future outflow of economic benefits from the Group to settle the obligation. Uncertain tax positions are assessed and measured on an issue by issue basis within the jurisdictions that we operate using management’s estimate of the most likely outcome. The Group recognises interest on late paid taxes as part of financing costs, and any penalties, if applicable, as part of the income tax expense.\n\nDeferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in the future arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. It is accounted for using the statement of financial position liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that temporary differences or taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.\n\nSuch assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised to the extent they arise from the initial recognition of non-tax deductible goodwill.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint arrangements, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting period date and adjusted to reflect changes in the Group’s assessment that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.\n\nTax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they either relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities which intend to settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\n\nTax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the tax is recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity.\n\nIncome tax expense\n\n2019 €m\n\n2018 €m\n\nUnited Kingdom corporation tax expense/(credit):\n\nCurrent year1 Adjustments in respect of prior years\n\n21 (9) 12\n\n70 (5) 65\n\nOverseas current tax expense/(credit):\n\nCurrent year Adjustments in respect of prior years\n\nTotal current tax expense\n\n1,098 (48) 1,050 1,062\n\n1,055 (102) 953 1,018\n\nDeferred tax on origination and reversal of temporary differences:\n\nUnited Kingdom deferred tax Overseas deferred tax\n\nTotal deferred tax expense/(credit) Total income tax expense/(credit)\n\n(232) 666 434 1,496\n\n39 (1,936) (1,897) (879)\n\nNote: 1 The income statement tax charge includes tax relief on capitalised interest.\n\nUK operating profits are more than offset by statutory allowances for capital investment in the UK network and systems plus ongoing interest costs including those arising from the €10.3 billion of spectrum payments to the UK government in 2000 and 2013.\n\n2017 €m\n\n27 (3) 24\n\n961 (35) 926 950\n\n', 'The following is a reconciliation from the statutory federal income tax rate to our effective income tax rate:\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n2017 2018 2019 (Percentage of pre-tax income)\n\nStatutory federal income tax rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n21.0 %\n\n21.0 %\n\n35.0 %\n\nState income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n(1.6)%\n\n(1.5)%\n\n3.9 %\n\nImpairment of goodwill . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n(28.6)%\n\n(36.6)%\n\n— %\n\nChange in liability for unrecognized tax position . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n(0.2)%\n\n1.3 %\n\n1.0 %\n\nTax reform . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n— %\n\n(5.9)%\n\n(209.8)%\n\nNet foreign income taxes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n(0.5)%\n\n1.8 %\n\n(0.7)%\n\nForeign dividend paid to a domestic parent company . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n— %\n\n— %\n\n0.2 %\n\nResearch and development credits . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n0.1 %\n\n0.9 %\n\n(1.4)%\n\nTax impact on sale of data centers and colocation business . . . . . . . . . .\n\n— %\n\n— %\n\n5.0 %\n\nTax benefit of net operating loss carryback . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n— %\n\n9.1 %\n\n— %\n\nLevel 3 acquisition transaction costs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n— %\n\n— %\n\n6.0 %\n\nOther, net\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n(0.8)%\n\n(1.0)%\n\n3.6 %\n\nEffective income tax rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n(10.6)%\n\n(10.9)%\n\n(157.2)%\n\nThe effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 include a $1.4 billion and a $572 million unfavorable impact of non-deductible goodwill impairments, respectively.

The assumptions used for the plans are based upon customary rates and practices for the location of the plans. Factors such as asset class allocations, long-term rates of return (actual and expected), and results of periodic asset liability modeling studies are considered when constructing the long-term rate of return assumption for our defined benefit pension plans.\n\nWeighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the plans at the end of each period were\n\nas follows:\n\nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nDiscount rate Rate of compensation increase\n\n2.0% 2.7%\n\n1.8% 2.6%\n\nIn selecting the appropriate discount rate for the plans, the Company uses country-specific information, adjusted to reflect\n\nthe duration of the particular plan. The discount rate was based on highly rated long-term bond indexes and yield curves that match the duration of the plan’s benefit obligations.\n\nDefined Contribution Plans\n\nAutodesk also provides defined contribution plans in certain foreign countries where required by statute. Autodesk’s funding policy for foreign defined contribution plans is consistent with the local requirements in each country. Autodesk’s contributions to these plans were $29.6 million in fiscal 2019, $27.2 million in fiscal 2018, and $26.6 million in fiscal 2017.\n\nCash Balance Plans\n\nAutodesk provides a cash balance plan that insures the risks of disability, death, and longevity, in which the vested\n\npension capital is reinvested and provides a 100% capital and interest guarantee. The weighted-average guaranteed interest crediting rate for cash balance plans was 1.0%, 1.0%, and 1.3% for mandatory retirement savings and 0.3%, 0.3%, and 0.8% for supplementary retirement savings for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\n\nOther Plans\n\nIn addition, Autodesk offers a non-qualified deferred compensation plan to certain key employees whereby they may defer a portion (or all) of their annual compensation until retirement or a different date specified by the employee in accordance with terms of the plan. See Note 7, “Deferred Compensation,” for further discussion.\n\n16. Restructuring and other exit costs, net\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Board of Directors approved a world-wide restructuring plan (“Fiscal 2018 Plan”) to support the Company's strategic priorities of completing the subscription transition, digitizing the Company, and re-imagining manufacturing, construction, and production. Through the restructuring, Autodesk seeks to reduce its investments in areas not aligned with its strategic priorities, including in areas related to research and development and go-to-market activities. At the same time, Autodesk plans to further invest in strategic priority areas related to digital infrastructure, customer success, and construction. By re-balancing resources to better align with the Company’s strategic priorities, Autodesk is positioning itself to meet its long-term goals. This world-wide restructuring plan included a reduction in force of approximately 11% of the Company’s workforce, or 1,027 employees, and the consolidation of certain leased facilities. By January 31, 2019, the personnel and facilities related actions included in this restructuring plan were substantially complete.\n\nDuring Fiscal 2019, restructuring charges under the Fiscal 2018 Plan included $39.2 million in employee termination\n\nbenefits and $3.2 million in lease termination and other exit costs.\n\n2019 Form 10-K 104\n\n2017\n\n1.7% 2.6%\n\nThe following tables set forth the restructuring charges and other facility exit costs, net during the fiscal years ended\n\nJanuary 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\nBalances, January 31, 2018\n\nAdditions\n\nPayments\n\nAdjustments (1)\n\nBalances, January 31, 2019\n\nFiscal 2018 Plan\n\nEmployee terminations costs\n\n$\n\n53.0\n\n$\n\n39.2\n\n$\n\n(89.7) $\n\n(0.5) $\n\n2.0\n\nFacility terminations and other exit costs\n\n2.5\n\n3.2\n\n(5.7)\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n55.5\n\n$\n\n42.4\n\n$\n\n(95.4) $\n\n(0.4) $\n\n2.1\n\nCurrent portion (2)\n\n$\n\n55.5\n\n$\n\n2.1\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n55.5\n\n$\n\n2.1\n\n____________________ (1) Adjustments primarily relate to the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, settlement of lease contracts, and certain write offs related\n\n(2)\n\nto fixed assets.

Volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was flat in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior-year period. This result reflected merchandising changes and price elasticity-related declines in certain brands, as well as isolated production challenges, partially offset by the continued benefit from momentum and innovation successes in the snacks businesses. Price/ mix was flat compared to the prior year as unfavorable mix, coupled with increases in brand building investments with retailers were offset by the impact of higher pricing. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC, which was completed in October 2017, contributed $41.3 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 results included $115.9 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $156.4 million of net sales related to this divested business.\n\nRefrigerated & Frozen net sales for fiscal 2019 were $2.80 billion, an increase of $51.0 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 1% increase in volume compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales volumes was a result of innovation across multiple brands, which was partially offset by the effects of reduced merchandising spend and the impact of a recall during the fourth quarter. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2018, as continued delivery of top-line accretive innovation in several brands was partially offset by brand building investments with retailers. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business, which was completed in February 2018, contributed $25.7 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition.\n\nInternational net sales for fiscal 2019 were $793.4 million, a decrease of $50.1 million, or 6%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 2% increase in volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, a 4% decrease due to foreign exchange rates, and a 2% increase in price/mix, in each case compared to fiscal 2018. The volume and price/ mix increases for fiscal 2019 were driven by growth in the Canadian snacks and frozen businesses. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $3.7 million to International net sales for fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 included $4.1 million of net sales related to our Del Monte® processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada, which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $48.9 million of net sales related to this divested business. In addition, fiscal 2019 and 2018 results included $17.1 million and $24.5 million, respectively, related to our divested Wesson® oil business.\n\nFoodservice net sales for fiscal 2019 were $934.2 million, a decrease of $120.6 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 14% decrease in volume, excluding divestitures. The decline in volume reflected the continued execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy and the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Price/mix increased 5% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in price/mix for fiscal 2019 reflected favorable product and customer mix, the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing, and the execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy. Fiscal 2019 included $34.2 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $53.4 million of net sales related to this divested business. Net sales declined by approximately 7% in fiscal 2019 due to the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility.\n\nPinnacle Foods net sales for fiscal 2019 (reflecting 213 days of Conagra Brands ownership) were $1.73 billion.

In local currency, adjusted EBITDA amounted to US$351.3 million compared to US$288.4 million for fiscal 2018. The increase was mainly due to the impact of the MetroCast and FiberLight acquisitions combined with strong organic growth.\n\nExcluding the MetroCast and FiberLight acquisitions and the prior year\'s non-recurring costs of $3.1 million ($US2.5 million) related to hurricane Irma, adjusted EBITDA in constant currency increased by 5.7% for fiscal 2019.\n\nCAPITAL INTENSITY AND ACQUISITIONS OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\n\nFiscal 2019 acquisitions of property, plant and equipment decreased by 9.4% (12.4% in constant currency) mainly due to:\n\n\n\nthe acquisition of several dark fibres throughout south Florida from FiberLight, LLC for a consideration of $21.2 million (US$16.8 million) during the second quarter of fiscal 2018; partly offset by\n\n\n\nadditional capital expenditures related to the impact of the MetroCast acquisition; and\n\n\n\nadditional capital expenditures related to the expansion in Florida.\n\nFiscal 2019 capital intensity reached 18.6% compared to 25.1% for fiscal 2018 mainly as a result of lower capital expenditures combined with revenue growth.\n\nCUSTOMER STATISTICS\n\nCustomer counts at August 31, 2019\n\nCustomer counts at August 31, 2018\n\nInternet 446,137 49.5%\n\nInternet 424,948 48.0%\n\nVideo 312,555 34.7%\n\nTelephony 142,754 15.8%\n\nVideo 317,252 35.9%\n\nTelephony 142,265 16.1%\n\nNet additions (losses)\n\n% of penetration(2)(3)\n\nYears ended\n\nAugust 31, 2019\n\nAugust 31, 2019\n\nAugust 31,\n\n2018 (1)\n\nAugust 31, 2019\n\nAugust 31,\n\n2018 (3)\n\nPrimary service units\n\n901,446\n\n16,981\n\n20,251\n\nInternet service customers\n\n446,137\n\n21,189\n\n21,417\n\n50.8\n\n49.7\n\nVideo service customers\n\n312,555\n\n(4,697)\n\n(6,760)\n\n35.6\n\n37.1\n\nTelephony service customers\n\n142,754\n\n489\n\n5,594\n\n16.2\n\n16.6\n\n(1) Excludes 251,379 primary services units (130,404 Internet services, 87,873 video services and 33,102 telephony services) from the MetroCast acquisition\n\ncompleted in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\n\n(2) As a percentage of homes passed.\n\n(3) In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the number of homes passed in the American broadband services segment have been adjusted upwards in order to reflect the number of non-served multi-dwelling unit passings within the footprint and consequently, the penetration as a percentage of homes passed for fiscal 2018 have also been adjusted.\n\n34 COGECO COMMUNICATIONS INC. 2019 ANNUAL REPORT MD&A\n\nINTERNET\n\nFiscal 2019 Internet service customers net additions stood at 21,189 compared to 21,417 for the prior year as a result of:\n\n\n\nadditional connects related to the Florida expansion initiatives and in the MetroCast footprint;\n\n\n\nour customers\' ongoing interest in high speed offerings; and\n\n\n\ngrowth in both the residential and business sectors.\n\nVIDEO\n\nFiscal 2019 video service customers net losses stood at 4,697 compared to 6,760 for the prior year mainly from:\n\n\n\ncompetitive offers in the industry; and\n\n\n\na changing video consumption environment; partly offset by\n\n\n\nour customers\' ongoing interest in TiVo\'s digital advanced video services; and\n\n\n\nthe activation of bulk properties in Florida during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.\n\nTELEPHONY\n\nFiscal 2019 telephony service customers net additions stood at 489 compared to 5,594 for the prior year mainly as a result of the growth in the business sector, partly offset by a decline in the residential sector.\n\nDISTRIBUTION OF CUSTOMERS\n\nAt August 31, 2019, 52% of the American broadband services segment\'s customers enjoyed ""double play"" or ""triple play"" bundled services.\n\nCOGECO COMMUNICATIONS INC.', 'HC2 HOLDINGS, INC.

We recognize an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount of a deferred cost exceeds the remaining amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the goods and services related to the cost, less the expected costs related directly to providing those goods and services that have not yet been recognized as expenses.

Acquisitions and Divestitures Spectrum License Transactions\n\nSince 2017, we have entered into or completed several strategic spectrum transactions including:\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of AT&T Inc. (AT&T) to exchange certain Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) and Personal Communication Services (PCS) spectrum licenses. This non-cash exchange was completed in February 2017. As a result, we received $1.0 billion of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and recorded a pre-tax gain of $126 million in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2017, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of Sprint Corporation to exchange certain PCS spectrum licenses. This non-cash exchange was completed in May 2017. As a result, we received $132 million of PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and recorded an insignificant gain in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of T-Mobile USA Inc. to exchange certain AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. This non-cash exchange was completed in December 2017. As a result, we received $414 million of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and recorded a pre-tax gain of $143 million in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\nDuring 2018, we entered into and completed various wireless license transactions, including the purchase of Straight Path Communications Inc. (Straight Path) and NextLink Wireless LLC (NextLink).\n\nDuring 2019, the FCC completed two millimeter wave spectrum license auctions. Verizon participated in these auctions and was the high bidder on 9 and 1,066 licenses, respectively, in the 24 Gigahertz (GHz) and 28 GHz bands. We submitted an application to the FCC and paid cash of approximately $521 million for the licenses. We received the licenses during the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\nDuring 2019, we entered into and completed various other wireless license acquisitions for an insignificant amount of cash consideration.\n\nIn December 2019, the FCC incentive auction for spectrum licenses in the upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz bands commenced. As an incumbent licensee, Verizon received vouchers related to our existing 39 GHz licenses. These vouchers can be converted into cash, the amount of which will not be known until the conclusion of the auction, or applied toward the purchase price of spectrum in the auction. At the conclusion of the auction, all existing licenses will be cancelled and new reconfigured licenses or cash will be distributed depending on the results of the auction. Due to the FCC’s rules restricting communications regarding the auction, we will not disclose our financial plans for the auction during the quiet period for this auction unless legally required. In addition, as of this time, until the completion of the auction process, we cannot determine the resulting financial outcome, including a potential gain or loss. Such gain or loss, if any, may be material.\n\nAcquisition of AOL Inc.\n\nIn May 2015, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with AOL Inc. (AOL) pursuant to which we commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of AOL at a price of $50.00 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.\n\nOn June 23, 2015, we completed the tender offer and merger, and AOL became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon.

Is the defined benefit plan open to new members?,"['172 Vodafone Group Plc\n\nAnnual Report 2019\n\n24. Post employment benefits\n\nThe Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans for our employees. The Group’s largest defined benefit scheme is in the UK. For further details see “Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty” in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAccounting policies For defined benefit retirement plans, the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the plan liabilities is recognised as an asset or liability on the statement of financial position. Scheme liabilities are assessed using the projected unit funding method and applying the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting period date. Assets are valued at market value.\n\nActuarial gains and losses are taken to the statement of comprehensive income as incurred. For this purpose, actuarial gains and losses comprise both the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising from differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred. The return on plan assets, in excess of interest income, and costs incurred for the management of plan assets are also taken to other comprehensive income.\n\nOther movements in the net surplus or deficit are recognised in the income statement, including the current service cost, any past service cost and the effect of any settlements. The interest cost less the expected interest income on assets is also charged to the income statement. The amount charged to the income statement in respect of these plans is included within operating costs or in the Group’s share of the results of equity accounted operations, as appropriate.\n\nThe Group’s contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the income statement as they fall due.\n\nBackground At 31 March 2019 the Group operated a number of pension plans for the benefit of its employees throughout the world, with varying rights and obligations depending on the conditions and practices in the countries concerned. The Group’s pension plans are provided through both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements. Defined benefit schemes provide benefits based on the employees’ length of pensionable service and their final pensionable salary or other criteria. Defined contribution schemes offer employees individual funds that are converted into benefits at the time of retirement.\n\nThe Group operates defined benefit schemes in Germany, Ghana, India, Ireland, Italy, the UK, the United States and the Group operates defined benefit indemnity plans in Greece and Turkey. Defined contribution pension schemes are currently provided in Egypt, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Portugal, South Africa, Spain and the UK.\n\nIncome statement expense\n\nDefined contribution schemes Defined benefit schemes Total amount charged to income statement (note 23)\n\n2019 €m 166 57 223\n\n2018 €m 178 44 222\n\n2017 €m 192 20 212\n\nDefined benefit schemes The Group’s retirement policy is to provide competitive pension provision, in each operating country, in line with the market median for that location. The Group’s preferred retirement provision is focused on Defined Contribution (‘DC’) arrangements and/or State provision for future service.\n\nThe Group’s main defined benefit funding liability is the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme (‘Vodafone UK plan’). Since June 2014 the plan has consisted of two segregated sections: the Vodafone Section and the Cable & Wireless Section (‘CWW Section’). Both sections are closed to new entrants and to future accrual. The Group also operates smaller funded and unfunded plans in the UK, funded and unfunded plans in Germany and funded plans in Ireland. Defined benefit pension provision exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as longer than expected longevity of participants, lower than expected return on investments and higher than expected inflation, which may increase the liabilities or reduce the value of assets of the schemes.\n\nThe main defined benefit schemes are administered by trustee boards which are legally separate from the Group and consist of representatives who are employees, former employees or are independent from the Company. The boards of the pension schemes are required by legislation to act in the best interest of the participants, set the investment strategy and contribution rates and are subject to statutory funding objectives.\n\nThe Vodafone UK plan is registered as an occupational pension plan with HM Revenue and Customs (‘HMRC’) and is subject to UK legislation and operates within the framework outlined by the Pensions Regulator. UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently and that valuations are undertaken at least every three years. Separate valuations are required for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section.\n\nThe trustees obtain regular actuarial valuations to check whether the statutory funding objective is met and whether a recovery plan is required to restore funding to the level of the agreed technical provisions. On 19 October 2017, the 31 March 2016 triennial actuarial valuation for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section of the Vodafone UK plan, which is used to judge the funding the Group needs to put into the scheme, was concluded.', 'COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\n13. EMPLOYEE STOCK AWARD AND BENEFIT PLANS (Continued)\n\nwithheld to cover tax payments was 120,000 in fiscal 2019, 131,000 in fiscal 2018 and 131,000 in fiscal 2017; tax payments made were $15.2 million, $36.3 million and $15.7 million, respectively.\n\n14. DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS\n\nAs a result of the Rofin acquisition, we have assumed all assets and liabilities of Rofin’s defined benefit plans for the Rofin-Sinar Laser, GmbH (‘‘RSL’’) and Rofin-Sinar Inc. (‘‘RS Inc.’’) employees. The U.S. plan began in fiscal 1995 and is partially funded. Any new employees hired after January 1, 2007, are not eligible for the RS Inc. pension plan. As is the customary practice with German companies, the German pension plan is unfunded. Any new employees hired after 2000 are not eligible for the RSL pension plan. The measurement date of these pension plans is September 30. For these pension plans, actuarial gains and losses are deferred into OCI and amortized over future periods.\n\nEffective January 1, 2012, the RS Inc. defined benefit plan was amended to exclude highly compensated employees, as defined by the Internal Revenue Service, from receiving future years of service under the RS Inc. defined benefit plan. A non-qualified defined benefit plan was created to replace the benefits lost by the employees that were otherwise excluded from the qualified defined benefit plan. Effective August 31, 2018 both the RS Inc. plans were amended to freeze all future compensation benefit accruals.\n\nIn addition, we have defined benefit plans in South Korea, Japan, Spain and Italy, covering all\n\nfull-time employees with at least one year of service, and a defined benefit plan in Germany covering two individuals. As is the customary practice with European and Asian companies, the plans are unfunded, with the exception of the Spanish plan which is partially funded. We have elected to recognize all actuarial gains and losses on these plans immediately, as incurred. The measurement date of these defined benefit plans is September 30.\n\nFor financial reporting purposes, the calculation of net periodic pension costs is based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations, an assumed rate of return on pension assets and an assumed rate of compensation increase for employees covered by the plan.

These technologies consist of both hardware and software offerings, including software licenses and software-as-a-service (SaaS), that help our customers build networks, automate, orchestrate, integrate, and digitize data. We are shifting and expanding more of our business to software and subscriptions across our core networking portfolio. Our hardware and perpetual software in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses are multiple performance obligations where the term license is recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.\n\nApplications consists of offerings that utilize the core networking and data center platforms to provide their functions. The products consist primarily of software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS, as well as hardware. Our perpetual software and hardware in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses are multiple performance obligations where the term license is recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.\n\nSecurity primarily includes our network security, cloud and email security, identity and access management, advanced threat protection, and unified threat management products. These products consist of both hardware and software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS. Updates and upgrades for the term software licenses are critical for our software to perform its intended commercial purpose because of the continuous need for our software to secure our customers’ network environments against frequent threats. Therefore, security software licenses are generally represented by a single distinct performance obligation with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.\n\nOther Products primarily include our Service Provider Video Software Solutions and cloud and system management products. On October 28, 2018, we completed the sale of the SPVSS. These products include both hardware and software licenses. Our offerings in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control.\n\nIn addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service and support options for our customers, including technical support services and advanced services. Technical support services represent the majority of these offerings which are distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Advanced services are distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time with revenue recognized as services are delivered.\n\n72\n\nThe sales arrangements as discussed above are typically made pursuant to customer purchase orders based on master purchase or partner agreements. Cash is received based on our standard payment terms which is typically 30 days. We provide financing arrangements to customers for all of our hardware, software and service offerings. Refer to Note 8 for additional information. For these arrangements, cash is typically received over time.\n\n(b) Contract Balances\n\nAccounts receivable, net was $5.5 billion as of July 27, 2019 compared to $5.6 billion as of July 28, 2018.\n\nContract assets consist of unbilled receivables and are recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of scheduled billings to our customers. These amounts are primarily related to software and service arrangements where transfer of control has occurred but we have not yet invoiced. As of July 27, 2019 and July 29, 2018, our contract assets for these unbilled receivables were $860 million and $122 million, respectively, and were included in other current assets and other assets.\n\nContract liabilities consist of deferred revenue.']","The Group's revenue is diversified across its entire end customer base, with no single end user accounting for greater than 10 percent of the Group’s revenue in either 2018 or 2019.

What is the number of non-vested shares granted in 2019?,"['Stock Awards\n\nWe have granted RSUs to our employees, consultants and members of our Board of Directors, and PSUs to\n\ncertain executives.\n\nIn February 2016, we granted 547,000 PSUs with certain financial and operational targets. Actual performance, as measured at the time and prior to the restatement of the 2016 financial statements, resulted in participants achieving 80% of target. Given the PSUs did not contain explicit or implicit claw back rights, there was no change to stock-based compensation expense for the impact of the previously disclosed restatement of the 2016 consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2019, 253,203 shares had vested, 200,297 shares had been forfeited, and the remaining 93,500 shares will vest (as to 80%) in annual tranches through February 2020 subject to continued service vesting requirements.\n\nIn October 2018, we granted 464,888 PSUs with certain financial targets. These PSUs will become eligible to vest at 75% upon the achievement of the performance targets by December 31, 2020, and are subject to service condition vesting requirements. The remaining 25% of these PSUs will become eligible to vest on the first anniversary of the initial vesting date. None of these PSUs were vested as of December 31, 2019.\n\nIn April 2019, we granted 346,453 PSUs with certain financial targets. These PSUs will become eligible to vest at 75% on the second month following achievement of certain performance targets by December 31, 2021, with the remaining 25% of the PSUs to vest on the first anniversary of the initial vesting date, subject to continued service vesting requirements. None of these PSUs were vested as of December 31, 2019.\n\nIn December 2019, we granted 375,000 PSUs with certain market performance-based targets to be achieved between December 2019 and December 2023. One-third of each tranche of these PSUs will become eligible to vest on each of the three anniversaries of the date the performance-based target is achieved, subject to continued service vesting requirements. The grant date fair values of each tranche of these PSUs were estimated to be $4.59, $4.06 and $3.59 and determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model with the following assumptions: expected term of 4.0 years, expected volatility of 38.45%, risk-free interest rate of 1.7% and expected dividend yield of 0.0%.

Diluted net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period plus potential dilutive common shares, including stock options, RSUs and employee stock purchase rights, unless the potential common shares are anti-dilutive. Since we had net losses in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, none of the potential dilutive common shares were included in the computation of diluted shares for these periods, as inclusion of such shares would have been anti-dilutive.\n\n', 'Table of Contents\n\nCOGENT COMMUNICATIONS HOLDINGS, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\n8.

When is the impairment of goodwill and tangible assets tested?,"['2019 Annual Report and Accounts\n\nStrategic ReportCorporate GovernanceAdditional InformationIntroduction\n\nFinancial Statements\n\n17 Impairment of Goodwill and Intangibles\n\nBefore recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows:\n\n31 March 2019 $M\n\n31 March 2018 $M\n\nAmericas\n\n273.6\n\n288.2\n\nEMEA\n\n413.0\n\n434.2\n\nAPJ\n\n98.7\n\n103.6\n\n785.3\n\n826.0\n\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets is tested annually, or more frequently where there is indication of impairment.\n\nWhere the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\nGoodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the cash-generating unit to which it relates is greater than the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use.\n\nFor the year-ended 31 March 2019, the Directors have reviewed the value of goodwill based on internal value in use calculations. The key assumptions for these calculations are discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to billings and direct costs during the period.\n\nThe Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the Directors’ most recent financial forecasts for the following five years. The growth rates for the five-year period are based on Directors’ expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the cash-generating unit, planned growth in market share, industry forecasts, growth in the market and specific regional considerations and are in line with past experience. Discount rates have been estimated based on rates that reflect current market assessments of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital.\n\nThe key assumptions used in the assessments in the year-ended 31 March 2019 are as follows:\n\nAmericas\n\nEMEA\n\nAPJ\n\nLong-term regional growth rate beyond five years\n\n2.5%\n\n1.5%\n\n2.0%\n\nDiscount rate\n\n9.0%\n\n9.0%\n\n10.0%\n\nThe key assumptions used in the assessments in the year-ended 31 March 2018 were as follows:\n\nAmericas\n\nEMEA\n\nAPJ\n\nLong-term regional growth rate beyond five years\n\n2.5%\n\n1.5%\n\n2.0%\n\nDiscount rate\n\n9.5%\n\n9.5%\n\n10.5%\n\nAs at 31 March 2019, there were no indicators of impairment that suggested the carrying amounts of the Group’s long-lived assets are not recoverable. In order to assess the sensitivity in the assumptions made, the Directors have flexed the discount rate upward by thirty per cent of the above rates, and noted that this still did not give any indication of impairment.\n\n153', 'The following table summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the fiscal years ended January 31,\n\n2019 and 2018:\n\nJanuary 31, 2019\n\nJanuary 31, 2018\n\nGoodwill, beginning of the year\n\n$\n\n1,769.4\n\n$\n\n1,710.3\n\nLess: accumulated impairment losses, beginning of the year\n\n(149.2)\n\n(149.2)\n\nAdditions arising from acquisitions during the year\n\n866.9\n\n—\n\nEffect of foreign currency translation, measurement period adjustments, and other (1)\n\n(36.3)\n\n59.1\n\nGoodwill, end of the year\n\n$\n\n2,450.8\n\n$\n\n1,620.2\n\n_______________ (1) Purchase accounting adjustments reflect revisions made to the Company’s preliminary determination of estimated fair value of assets\n\nand liabilities assumed during fiscal 2019 and 2018.\n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nAt least annually or more frequently as circumstances dictate, Autodesk reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever impairment indicators exist. Autodesk continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate the carrying amounts of its long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, Autodesk assesses recoverability of these assets. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the carrying amounts of the assets to the future undiscounted cash flow the assets are expected to generate. If the long-lived assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. Autodesk did not recognize any material impairments of long-lived assets during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\n\nIn addition to the recoverability assessments, Autodesk routinely reviews the remaining estimated useful lives of its long-\n\nlived assets. Any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made, as well as in subsequent quarters.\n\nDeferred Tax Assets\n\nDeferred tax assets arise primarily from tax credits, net operating losses, and timing differences for reserves, accrued liabilities, stock options, deferred revenue, purchased technologies, and capitalized intangibles, partially offset by U.S. deferred tax liabilities on acquired intangibles, and valuation allowances against U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets. Autodesk performed a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets and believes it will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize the net deferred tax assets. They are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce gross deferred tax assets to the amount that is ""more likely than not"" to be realized.\n\nStock-based Compensation Expense\n\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, as\n\nfollows:\n\nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nCost of subscription and maintenance revenue\n\n$\n\n13.2\n\n$\n\n11.9\n\n$\n\n8.6\n\nCost of other revenue\n\n4.3\n\n4.0\n\n5.5\n\nMarketing and sales\n\n109.4\n\n107.3\n\n94.1\n\nResearch and development\n\n82.6\n\n82.9\n\n81.3\n\nGeneral and administrative\n\n40.0\n\n55.3\n\n32.3\n\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock awards and Employee Qualified\n\nStock Purchase Plan (""ESPP"") purchases\n\n249.5\n\n261.4\n\n221.8\n\nTax benefit\n\n(2.6)\n\n(2.6)\n\n(2.6)\n\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock awards and ESPP purchases,\n\nnet\n\n$\n\n246.9\n\n$\n\n258.8\n\n$\n\n219.2\n\n2019 Form 10-K 71\n\nt r o p e R\n\nl a u n n A 9 1 0 2\n\n2 0 1 9 A n n u a l\n\nR e p o r t\n\nAutodesk determines the grant date fair value of its share-based payment awards using a Black-Scholes Merton (""BSM"") option pricing model or the quoted stock price on the date of grant, unless the awards are subject to market conditions, in which case Autodesk uses a binomial-lattice model (e.g., Monte Carlo simulation model).

The expected volatility for performance stock units subject to market conditions includes the expected volatility of Autodesk\'s peer companies within the S&P Computer Software Select Index or S&P North American Technology Software Index with a market capitalization over $2.00 billion, depending on the award type.\n\nAutodesk estimates the expected life of stock-based awards using both exercise behavior and post-vesting termination\n\nbehavior as well as consideration of outstanding options. The range of expected lives of ESPP awards are based upon the four, six-month exercise periods within a 24-month offering period.\n\nAutodesk did not pay cash dividends in fiscal 2019, 2018, or 2017 and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in\n\nthe foreseeable future. Consequently, an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the BSM option pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation model.\n\nThe risk-free interest rate used in the BSM option pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation model for stock-based\n\nawards is the historical yield on U.S. Treasury securities with equivalent remaining lives.\n\nAutodesk recognizes expense only for the stock-based awards that ultimately vest.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill\n\nThe Company evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the beginning of the fourth quarter each year and at an interim date, if indicators of potential impairment exist. Goodwill impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (also known as a component), for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit.\n\nAt the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test on its reporting units. The Company utilizes a combination of an income and market value approach to estimate the fair value of each of its reporting units. Cash flow projections are based on management’s estimates of revenue growth rates and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (""EBITDA"") margins, taking into consideration business and market conditions for the countries and markets in which the reporting unit operates. The Company calculates the discount rate based on a market-participant, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, which considers industry specific rates of return on debt and equity capital for a target industry capital structure, adjusted for risks associated with business size, geography and other factors specific to the reporting unit. The market value approach is based on appropriate valuation multiples observed for the reporting unit’s guideline public companies.\n\nThe goodwill impairment assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the\n\nreporting units exceeded its respective carrying value. The Company does not believe that any of its reporting units are at risk for impairment.\n\nA summary of the changes in goodwill by reportable segment is as follows:\n\n(Dollars in Millions)\n\nAutomotive\n\nIndustrial\n\nTotal\n\nBalance as of April 30, 2016\n\nForeign Currency Translation\n\nBalance as of April 29, 2017\n\n$\n\n— $\n\n—\n\n—\n\n1.7 (0.1) 1.6\n\n$\n\n1.7 (0.1) 1.6\n\nAcquisitions\n\n57.2\n\n—\n\n57.2\n\nForeign Currency Translation\n\n0.3\n\n0.1\n\n0.4\n\nBalance as of April 28, 2018\n\n57.5\n\n1.7\n\n59.2\n\nAcquisitions\n\nForeign Currency Translation\n\nBalance as of April 27, 2019\n\n$\n\n49.4 (0.6) 106.3\n\n$\n\n125.9 (0.6) 127.0\n\n$\n\n175.3 (1.2) 233.3\n\n']","Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets is tested annually, or more frequently where there is indication of impairment.","tested annually, or more frequently where there is indication of impairment",1.0,0.9999999999666667,0.9999999999666667,1.0,0.9637165735855208

Professional services were higher in the prior year period as a result of professional services incurred in connection with our acquisition of Cyence andimplementation costs of a new enterprise resource planning platform and a new product configuration and quoting system.Our general and administrative headcount was 298 as of July 31, 2019 compared with 255 as of July 31, 2018.

The increase was primarily attributable to a $11.8 million increase in payroll and related expenses, primarily consisting of salaries and incentive-based compensation, a $8.7 million increase in ERP integration and technology transition costs, a $4.0 million increase in rent and software costs, and a $2.8 million increase in consulting expenses.

As of April 27, 2019 and April 28, 2018, capital expenditures recorded in accounts payable totaled $6.4 million and $9.0 million, respectively.\n\nIncome Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting\n\nand tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“U.S. Tax Reform”) includes a new global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”)\n\nprovision which requires the Company to include foreign subsidiary earnings in its U.S. tax return starting in fiscal 2019. The FASB Staff Q&A, Topic 740 No. 5, ""Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income,"" states that an entity can make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse in future years or provide for the tax expense in the year the tax is incurred. The Company has elected to recognize the tax on GILTI as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred and therefore has not included any deferred tax impacts of GILTI in its consolidated financial statements for its fiscal year ended April 27, 2019.\n\nRevenue Recognition. On April 29, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 606,\n\n“Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” using the modified retrospective transition method. Under the new standard, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard was recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. In accordance with the modified retrospective transition method, the historical information within the financial statements has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standard in effect for those periods. As a result, the Company has disclosed the accounting policies in effect prior to April 29, 2018, as well as the policies it has applied starting April 29, 2018. See Note 2, ""Revenue,"" for further details.\n\nPeriods prior to April 29, 2018\n\nRevenue was recognized in accordance with ASC 605, ""Revenue Recognition."" Revenue was recognized upon either\n\nshipment or delivery (depending on shipping terms) of product to customers and is recorded net of returns, allowances, customer discounts, and incentives. Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities were accounted for on a net (excluded from revenues) basis.\n\nPeriods commencing on or after April 29, 2018\n\nThe majority of the Company\'s revenue is recognized at a point in time. The Company has determined that the most\n\ndefinitive demonstration that control has transferred to a customer is physical shipment or delivery, depending on the contractual shipping terms, with the exception of consignment transactions. Consignment transactions are arrangements where the Company transfers product to a customer location but retains ownership and control of such product until it is used by the customer.
