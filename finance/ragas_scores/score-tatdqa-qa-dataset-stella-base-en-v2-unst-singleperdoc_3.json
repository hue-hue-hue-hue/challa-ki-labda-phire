From time to time, the Company may audit or otherwise dispute royalties reported from licensees. Any adjusted royalty revenue as a result of such audits or dispute is recorded by the Company in the period in which such adjustment is agreed to by the Company and the licensee or otherwise determined.\n\nRevenue from the Company\u2019s patent licensing business is generated from negotiated license agreements. The timing and amount of revenue recognized from each licensee depends upon a variety of factors, including the terms of each agreement and the nature of the obligations of the parties. These agreements may include, but not be limited to, elements related to past infringement liabilities, non-refundable upfront license fees, and ongoing royalties on licensed products sold by the licensee. Generally, in the event of settlement of litigation related to the Company\u2019s assertion of patent infringement involving its intellectual property, defendants will either pay (i) a non-refundable lump sum payment for a non-exclusive fully-paid license (a \u201cFully-Paid License\u201d), or (ii) a non-refundable lump sum payment (license initiation fee) together with an ongoing obligation to pay quarterly or monthly royalties to the Company for the life of the licensed patent (a \u201cRoyalty Bearing License\u201d).\n\nThe Company\u2019s license agreements, both Fully-Paid Licenses and Royalty Bearing Licenses, typically include some combination of the following: (i) the grant of a non- exclusive license to manufacture and\/or sell products covered by its patented technologies; (ii) the release of the licensee from certain claims, and (iii) the dismissal of any pending litigation. The intellectual property rights granted pursuant to these licenses typically extend until the expiration of the related patents. Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, the Company typically has no further performance obligations with respect to the grant of the non-exclusive licenses. Generally, the license agreements provide for the grant of the licenses, releases, and other obligations following execution of the agreement and the receipt of the up-front lump sum payment for a Fully-Paid License or a license initiation fee for a Royalty Bearing License.\n\nOngoing Royalty Payments: Certain of the Company\u2019s revenue from Royalty Bearing Licenses results from the calculation of royalties based on a licensee\u2019s actual quarterly sales (one licensee pays monthly royalties) of licensed products, applied to a contractual royalty rate. Licensees that pay royalties on a quarterly basis generally report to the Company actual quarterly sales and related quarterly royalties due within 45 days after the end of the quarter in which such sales activity takes place. Licensees with Royalty Bearing Licenses are obligated to provide the Company with quarterly (or monthly) royalty reports that summarize their sales of licensed products and their related royalty obligations to the Company. The Company receives these royalty reports subsequent to the period in which its licensees underlying sales occurred. The amount of royalties due under Royalty Bearing Licenses, each quarter, cannot be reasonably estimated by management.\n\nConsequently, the Company recognizes revenue for the period in which the royalty report is received in arrears and other revenue recognition criteria are met.\n\n","The Company\u2019s software license arrangements with its customers often include multiple promises to transfer licensed software products and services. Determining whether the products and\/or services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment.\n\nThe Company\u2019s SaaS and PaaS arrangements may include variable consideration in the form of usage-based fees. If the arrangement that includes variable consideration in the form of usage-based fees does not meet the allocation exception for variable consideration, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration at the outset of the arrangement using either the expected value or most likely amount method, depending on the specifics of each arrangement. These estimates are constrained to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of incremental revenue will not occur and are updated each reporting period as additional information becomes available.\n\nJudgment is used in determining: (1) whether the financing component in a software license agreement is significant and, if so, (2) the discount rate used in calculating the significant financing component. The Company assesses the significance of the financing component based on the ratio of license fees paid over time to total license fees. If determined to be significant, the financing component is calculated using a rate that discounts the license fees to the cash selling price.\n\nJudgment is also used in assessing whether the extension of payment terms in a software license arrangement results in variable consideration and, if so, the amount to be included in the transaction price. The Company applies the portfolio approach to estimating the amount of variable consideration in these arrangements using the most likely amount method that is based on the Company\u2019s historical collection experience under similar arrangements.\n\nSignificant judgment is required to determine the SSP for each performance obligation, the amount allocated to each performance obligation and whether it depicts the amount that the Company expects to receive in exchange for the related product and\/or service. As the selling prices of the Company\u2019s software licenses are highly variable, the Company estimates SSP of its software licenses using the residual approach when the software license is sold with other services and observable SSPs exist for the other services. The Company uses a range of amounts to estimate SSP for maintenance and services. These ranges are based on stand-alone sales and vary based on the type of service and geographic region. If the SSP of a performance obligation is not directly observable, the Company will maximize observable inputs to determine its SSP.\n\nContract Balances\n\nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. The Company records an accrued receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing and the Company\u2019s right to consideration only requires the passage of time, or deferred revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing.\n\nTotal receivables represent amounts billed and amounts earned that are to be billed in the future (i.e., accrued receivables). Included in accrued receivables are services and SaaS and PaaS revenues earned in the current period but billed in the following period and amounts due under multi-year software license arrangements with extended payment terms for which the Company has an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment subsequent to invoicing.\n\nTotal receivables, net is comprised of the following (in thousands):\n\nDecember 31,\n\nBilled receivables Allowance for doubtful accounts\n\nBilled receivables, net\n\nAccrued receivables Significant financing component\n\nTotal accrued receivables, net Less: current accrued receivables Less: current significant financing component\n\nTotal long-term accrued receivables, net\n\n$\n\n2019 213,654 $ (5,149 ) 208,505 399,302 (35,569 ) 363,733 161,714 (11,022 ) 213,041 572,238 $\n\n2018 239,275 (3,912 ) 235,363 336,858 (35,029 ) 301,829 123,053 (10,234 ) 189,010 537,192\n\nTotal receivables, net\n\n$\n\nNo customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company\u2019s consolidated receivables balance as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\n","3.

These technologies consist of both hardware and software offerings, including software licenses and software-as-a-service (SaaS), that help our customers build networks, automate, orchestrate, integrate, and digitize data. We are shifting and expanding more of our business to software and subscriptions across our core networking portfolio. Our hardware and perpetual software in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses are multiple performance obligations where the term license is recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.\n\nApplications consists of offerings that utilize the core networking and data center platforms to provide their functions. The products consist primarily of software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS, as well as hardware. Our perpetual software and hardware in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses are multiple performance obligations where the term license is recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.\n\nSecurity primarily includes our network security, cloud and email security, identity and access management, advanced threat protection, and unified threat management products. These products consist of both hardware and software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS. Updates and upgrades for the term software licenses are critical for our software to perform its intended commercial purpose because of the continuous need for our software to secure our customers\u2019 network environments against frequent threats. Therefore, security software licenses are generally represented by a single distinct performance obligation with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.\n\nOther Products primarily include our Service Provider Video Software Solutions and cloud and system management products. On October 28, 2018, we completed the sale of the SPVSS. These products include both hardware and software licenses. Our offerings in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control.\n\nIn addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service and support options for our customers, including technical support services and advanced services. Technical support services represent the majority of these offerings which are distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Advanced services are distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time with revenue recognized as services are delivered.\n\n72\n\nThe sales arrangements as discussed above are typically made pursuant to customer purchase orders based on master purchase or partner agreements. Cash is received based on our standard payment terms which is typically 30 days. We provide financing arrangements to customers for all of our hardware, software and service offerings.

Business Segments\n\nWe primarily derive our revenues from sales of our proprietary software (either as a direct license sale or under a subscription delivery model), which\n\nalso serves as the basis for our recurring service contracts for software support and maintenance and certain transaction-related services. In addition, we provide various other client services, including installation, and managed services such as outsourcing, private cloud hosting and revenue cycle management.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, we realigned our reporting structure as a result of the divestiture of our investment in Netsmart on December 31,\n\n2018, the evolution of the healthcare IT industry and our increased focus on the payer and life sciences market. As a result, we changed the presentation of our reportable segments to Provider and Veradigm. The new Provider segment is comprised of our core integrated clinical software applications, financial management and patient engagement solutions targeted at clients across the entire continuum of care. The new Veradigm segment primarily focuses on the payer and life sciences market. These changes to our reportable segments had no impact on operating segments. The segment disclosures below for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 have been revised to our current presentation.\n\nWe sold all of our investment in Netsmart on December 31, 2018. Prior to the sale, Netsmart comprised a separate reportable segment, which due to its significance to our historical consolidated financial statements and results of operations, is reported as a discontinued operation as a result of the sale. In addition, the results of operations related to two of the product offerings acquired with the EIS Business (Horizon Clinicals and Series2000) are also presented throughout these financial statements as discontinued operations and are included within the Provider reportable segment, except for acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments, which are included in \u201cUnallocated Amounts\u201d. Refer to Note 17, \u201cDiscontinued Operations.\u201d\n\nAs a result of the above changes, as of December 31, 2019, we had eight operating segments, which are aggregated into two reportable segments. The\n\nProvider reportable segment includes the Hospitals and Health Systems, Ambulatory, CarePort, FollowMyHealth\u00ae, EPSiTM, EIS-Classics and 2bPrecise strategic business units, each of which represents a separate operating segment. This reportable segment derives its revenue from the sale of integrated clinical software applications, financial management and patient engagement solutions, which primarily include EHR-related software, connectivity and coordinated care solutions, financial and practice management software, related installation, support and maintenance, outsourcing, private cloud hosting, revenue cycle management, training and electronic claims administration services. The Veradigm reportable segment is comprised of the Veradigm business unit, which represents a separate operating segment. This reportable segment provides data-driven clinical insights with actionable tools for clinical workflow, research, analytics and media.

We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes from potential claims or proceedings, as well as potential ranges of probable losses, when the outcomes of the claims or proceedings are probable and reasonably estimable. A determination of the amount of an accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after the analysis of each separate matter. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, we base our estimates on the information available at the time of our assessment. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates.\n\nNote 2. Recent Accounting Standards\n\nRecently adopted authoritative guidance\n\nRevenue Recognition \u2014 Contracts with Customers. In May 2014, the FASB issued new authoritative guidance for revenue from contracts with customers. The standard\u2019s core principle is that a company recognizes revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, companies are required to capitalize certain contract acquisition costs, including commissions paid, when contracts are signed. The asset recognized from capitalized incremental and recoverable acquisition costs is amortized on a straight-line basis consistent with the timing of transfer of the products or services to which the asset relates.\n\nAs a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance, our net revenue for fiscal\n\n2019 increased $47 million, and our operating expenses decreased $12 million. See Note 3 for additional information related to the impact of the new guidance on the timing and amounts of revenues recognized in fiscal 2019.\n\nThe effects of the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance on our March 29, 2019\n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:\n\n(In millions)\n\nAs Reported\n\nAs of March 29, 2019 Balances Without Adoption of New Standard\n\nEffect of Change\n\nAccounts receivable, net Other current assets (1) Other long-term assets (2) Total assets\n\n$ $ $ $\n\n708 435 1,262 15,938\n\n$ $ $ $\n\n657 421 1,213 15,824\n\n$ $ $ $\n\n51 14 49 114\n\nShort-term contract liabilities Other current liabilities Long-term contract liabilities Deferred income tax liabilities Total liabilities\n\n$ $ $ $ $\n\n2,320 533 736 577 10,200\n\n$ $ $ $ $\n\n2,437 494 837 526 10,328\n\n$ $ $ $ $\n\n(117) 39 (101) 51 (128)\n\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss Retained earnings Total stockholders\u2019 equity\n\n$ $ $\n\n(7) $ $ $\n\n933 5,738\n\n(2) $ $ $\n\n686 5,496\n\n(5) 247 242\n\n(1)\n\nAs reported includes short-term deferred commissions of $92 million.

There were no significant impairment losses related to our contract assets during the twelve months ended September 30, 2019.\n\nContract liabilities decreased $24.0 million during the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, due to revenue recognition in excess of payments received on these performance obligations. During the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2019, we recognized $62.4 million of our contract liabilities at October 1, 2018 as revenue.

As further described in Note 2, effective October 1, 2018, the component of accounts receivable that consisted of unbilled contract receivables as reported under ASC 605 has been reclassified as contract assets under ASC 606.\n\nIn our normal course of business, we may sell trade receivables to financial institutions as a cash management technique. We do not retain financial or legal obligations for these receivables that would result in material losses. Our ongoing involvement is limited to the remittance of customer payments to the financial institutions with respect to the sold trade receivables; therefore, our sold trade receivables are not included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet in any period presented. As of September 30, 2019, we sold $31.1 million of outstanding trade receivables to financial institutions.\n\n104","3.

These technologies consist of both hardware and software offerings, including software licenses and software-as-a-service (SaaS), that help our customers build networks, automate, orchestrate, integrate, and digitize data. We are shifting and expanding more of our business to software and subscriptions across our core networking portfolio. Our hardware and perpetual software in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses are multiple performance obligations where the term license is recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.\n\nApplications consists of offerings that utilize the core networking and data center platforms to provide their functions. The products consist primarily of software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS, as well as hardware. Our perpetual software and hardware in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses are multiple performance obligations where the term license is recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.\n\nSecurity primarily includes our network security, cloud and email security, identity and access management, advanced threat protection, and unified threat management products. These products consist of both hardware and software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS. Updates and upgrades for the term software licenses are critical for our software to perform its intended commercial purpose because of the continuous need for our software to secure our customers\u2019 network environments against frequent threats. Therefore, security software licenses are generally represented by a single distinct performance obligation with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.\n\nOther Products primarily include our Service Provider Video Software Solutions and cloud and system management products. On October 28, 2018, we completed the sale of the SPVSS. These products include both hardware and software licenses. Our offerings in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control.\n\nIn addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service and support options for our customers, including technical support services and advanced services. Technical support services represent the majority of these offerings which are distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Advanced services are distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time with revenue recognized as services are delivered.\n\n72\n\nThe sales arrangements as discussed above are typically made pursuant to customer purchase orders based on master purchase or partner agreements. Cash is received based on our standard payment terms which is typically 30 days. We provide financing arrangements to customers for all of our hardware, software and service offerings. Refer to Note 8 for additional information. For these arrangements, cash is typically received over time.\n\n(b) Contract Balances\n\nAccounts receivable, net was $5.5 billion as of July 27, 2019 compared to $5.6 billion as of July 28, 2018.\n\nContract assets consist of unbilled receivables and are recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of scheduled billings to our customers. These amounts are primarily related to software and service arrangements where transfer of control has occurred but we have not yet invoiced. As of July 27, 2019 and July 29, 2018, our contract assets for these unbilled receivables were $860 million and $122 million, respectively, and were included in other current assets and other assets.\n\nContract liabilities consist of deferred revenue."],"4":["Note 19: Segment, Geographic Information, and Major Customers\n\nThe Company operates in one reportable business segment: manufacturing and servicing of wafer processing semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

Product revenue increased by 6% and service revenue increased by 2%. Our total revenue reflected growth across each of our geographic segments. Product revenue for the BRICM countries, in the aggregate, experienced 1% product revenue decline, driven by a 16% decrease in product revenue in China and a decrease of 1% in Brazil. These decreases were partially offset by increased product revenue in Mexico, Russia and India of 26%, 6% and 5%, respectively.\n\nIn addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a reduced IT spending environment and reductions in spending by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple performance obligations; the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors. In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment.\n\n","gas, chemicals, mining, data centers, airports, and rail compa- nies. Competitors in the transmission business consist mainly of a small number of large multinational companies, increasingly joined by smaller, fast-growing manufacturers in emerging coun- tries including China, India and Korea.\n\nSeveral trends are affecting the businesses of the Operating Com- pany. In the power generation business, the ongoing strong growth in demand for power from renewable sources \u2013 which come with associated short-term fluctuations in power genera- tion levels \u2013 is shifting market demand from fossil baseload gen- eration to more flexible, highly efficient and affordable gas power plants with low emissions, in particular in Europe, Latin America and Asia. A second trend is that the development and execution of large projects increasingly requires financing by the OEM, in- cluding equity participation. For Gas and Power, this role is ful- filled by Financial Services, which can offer customers a range of financing and equity options backed by domain know-how. In general, the markets for the Operating Company are strongly af- fected by changes in national energy regulations, such as support of renewable energy, the security of supply through capacity mar- kets or strategic reserve capacity, carbon pricing and climate change targets, and modernization of energy and electricity mar- kets. Fuel efficiency standards in the U. S. and the European Union are expected to weigh on future demand for fossil transportation fuels in these regions, contrasting with strong growth in transpor- tation-related fuel use in other world regions, particularly in Asia.\n\nIn Oil and Gas, the role of natural gas compared to other fossil fuels is growing from the mid- to long-term perspective, facili- tated by its lower carbon footprint. Furthermore, declining pro- duction from maturing oil and gas fields, or depletion, requires improved recovery technologies as well as additional mechanical and electrical power, necessitating continuous investments. At the same time, oil and gas companies increasingly focus on asset economics and emission footprint, requiring products and solu- tions offering an improved balance of high asset productivity with safety and environmental performance. Generally, our oil and gas business benefits from these major market trends. At the same time, our diversified and global presence across the oil and gas value chain and other industries \u2013 each following their own business cycles \u2013 offers stable opportunities for our business.\n\nThe transmission business generally benefits from major trends and changes in global electrical power systems, in particular decarbonization, digitalization and global electrification. Decar- bonization is shifting the focus of generation to both central and decentral renewables. This shift increases demand for offshore connectivity and grid stability, requiring environmentally friendly products and systems. The integration of wind power, photo- voltaics, biomass, storage and other intermittent or distributed energy resources into efficient and reliable power networks\n\nincreases grid complexity. Holistic asset transparency to increase efficiency of existing grid assets and performance, enabled by digitalization, is becoming increasingly important. Digitalization involves increased product and system connectivity and provid- ing intelligent solutions for the management of complex energy networks. Connected assets provide value potential for additional services and enhanced asset operation. The continuously grow- ing demand for electricity worldwide requires stable transporta- tion of greener bulk power with minimal losses from the location of generation to different demand load centers, some of which may even be located in other countries.\n\nR & D activities of the power generation and oil and gas busi- nesses concentrate on developing products and solutions for enhancing efficiency and flexibility, and for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in power generation and in the oil and gas indus- try. These products and solutions include turbomachinery \u2013 primarily high-performance, low-emission gas turbines for sim- ple-cycle operation or for combined-cycle power plants \u2013 and compressor solutions combining electrical, automation, and digitalization offerings for oil and gas as well as process indus- tries. A field of activity is using hydrogen as a renewable fuel in gas turbines. Gas and Power is also intensifying R & D in innova- tive materials, advanced manufacturing methods and plant opti- mization. In the transmission business, R & D activities focus on preparing the portfolio for a deregulated environment in which total cost of ownership is decisive. Innovations accordingly focus on product digitalization, power electronics, software-driven power control, environmentally friendly products and systems, and grid stabilization. The increasing infeed of renewable energy to power grids, with distributed generation on the rise, requires those grids to become more flexible and efficient. The invest- ments of Gas and Power are focused on enhancing productivity through automation and increasing customer proximity via stra- tegic localization of capacity. Investing activities mainly relate to gas turbines and turbine components.\n\nFiscal year\n\n% Change\n\n(in millions of \u20ac)\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nActual\n\nComp.\n\nOrders\n\n19,975\n\n18,451\n\n8 %\n\n7 %\n\nRevenue\n\n17,663\n\n18,125\n\n(3) %\n\n(4) %\n\ntherein: service business\n\n8,025\n\n7,756\n\n3 %\n\n2 %\n\nAdjusted EBITA\n\n679\n\n722\n\n(6) %\n\nAdjusted EBITA margin\n\n3.8 %\n\n4.0 %\n\nOrders were up clearly year-over-year, due mainly to higher orders in the new-unit business.

General and administrative expenses for the yearended March 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2017 were negatively impacted by approximately $0.3 million primarily as a result of theweakening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and South African rand.

Determining whether the products and\/or services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment.\n\nThe Company\u2019s SaaS and PaaS arrangements may include variable consideration in the form of usage-based fees. If the arrangement that includes variable consideration in the form of usage-based fees does not meet the allocation exception for variable consideration, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration at the outset of the arrangement using either the expected value or most likely amount method, depending on the specifics of each arrangement. These estimates are constrained to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of incremental revenue will not occur and are updated each reporting period as additional information becomes available.\n\nJudgment is used in determining: (1) whether the financing component in a software license agreement is significant and, if so, (2) the discount rate used in calculating the significant financing component. The Company assesses the significance of the financing component based on the ratio of license fees paid over time to total license fees. If determined to be significant, the financing component is calculated using a rate that discounts the license fees to the cash selling price.\n\nJudgment is also used in assessing whether the extension of payment terms in a software license arrangement results in variable consideration and, if so, the amount to be included in the transaction price. The Company applies the portfolio approach to estimating the amount of variable consideration in these arrangements using the most likely amount method that is based on the Company\u2019s historical collection experience under similar arrangements.\n\nSignificant judgment is required to determine the SSP for each performance obligation, the amount allocated to each performance obligation and whether it depicts the amount that the Company expects to receive in exchange for the related product and\/or service. As the selling prices of the Company\u2019s software licenses are highly variable, the Company estimates SSP of its software licenses using the residual approach when the software license is sold with other services and observable SSPs exist for the other services. The Company uses a range of amounts to estimate SSP for maintenance and services. These ranges are based on stand-alone sales and vary based on the type of service and geographic region. If the SSP of a performance obligation is not directly observable, the Company will maximize observable inputs to determine its SSP.\n\nContract Balances\n\nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. The Company records an accrued receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing and the Company\u2019s right to consideration only requires the passage of time, or deferred revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing.\n\nTotal receivables represent amounts billed and amounts earned that are to be billed in the future (i.e., accrued receivables). Included in accrued receivables are services and SaaS and PaaS revenues earned in the current period but billed in the following period and amounts due under multi-year software license arrangements with extended payment terms for which the Company has an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment subsequent to invoicing.\n\nTotal receivables, net is comprised of the following (in thousands):\n\nDecember 31,\n\nBilled receivables Allowance for doubtful accounts\n\nBilled receivables, net\n\nAccrued receivables Significant financing component\n\nTotal accrued receivables, net Less: current accrued receivables Less: current significant financing component\n\nTotal long-term accrued receivables, net\n\n$\n\n2019 213,654 $ (5,149 ) 208,505 399,302 (35,569 ) 363,733 161,714 (11,022 ) 213,041 572,238 $\n\n2018 239,275 (3,912 ) 235,363 336,858 (35,029 ) 301,829 123,053 (10,234 ) 189,010 537,192\n\nTotal receivables, net\n\n$\n\nNo customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company\u2019s consolidated receivables balance as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\n"],"10":["Notes to the financial statements continued\n\n17 Joint operations The Group\u2019s interests in Cribbs Causeway and Manchester Arndale are accounted for as joint operations. The Group holds 50 per cent beneficial interests in the relevant freehold or leasehold of these properties. Each joint arrangement is governed by a Trust Deed giving each party rights to income and obligations for expenses in respect of their beneficial interest in the property. The management of the property is established under the Trust Deed as being undertaken by an entity jointly controlled by the beneficial owners of the property. This entity does not have the right to a share of the income or expenditure from the property, other than the receipt of a management fee. Therefore these interests are accounted for as joint operations.

Both companies are incorporated in India.\n\nThe equity method of accounting is applied to the Group\u2019s investments in Prozone and Empire in line with the requirements of IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. The results for the year to 30 September have been used as 31 December information is not available in time for these financial statements. Those results are adjusted to be in line with the Group\u2019s accounting policies and include the most recent property valuations, determined at 30 September 2019, by independent professionally qualified external valuers in line with the valuation methodology described in note 13.\n\nThe market price per share of Prozone at 31 December 2019 was INR19 (31 December 2018: INR29), valuing the Group\u2019s interest at \u00a39.9 million (31 December 2018: \u00a316.4 million) compared with the Prozone carrying value pre-impairment of \u00a341.5 million (31 December 2018: \u00a345.1 million). As the share price of Prozone is lower than its carrying value, a review of the carrying value of Prozone and the Group\u2019s direct interest in Empire (as it also forms part of the Prozone group) has been undertaken. Underpinning the impairment assessment (where the fair value less costs to sell was considered) were the independent third-party valuations received for the investment and development properties, representing the underlying value of the associate\u2019s net assets. Assumptions were also made for tax and other costs that would be reasonably expected if these assets were to be disposed of. Following this review, an impairment of \u00a37.4 million was recognised.\n\n136 136\n\nintu properties plc Annual report 2019 intu properties plc Annual report 2019\n\n2018\n\n64.8\n\n2.3\n\n\u2013\n\n(1.5)\n\n65.","PART II\n\nItem 5.

In addition, Film and Electrolytic net sales increased by $4.3 million, and MSA net sales increased by $13.8 million.\n\nThe increase in Solid Capacitors net sales was primarily driven by a $111.8 million increase in distributor sales across the Americas, APAC, and EMEA regions. The $111.8 million increase consisted of a $72.8 million increase in Ceramic product line sales and a $39.0 million increase in Tantalum product line sales. Also contributing to the increase in net sales was a $30.6 million increase in OEM sales across the APAC, EMEA, and JPKO regions, and a $28.0 million increase in EMS sales across all regions. These increases in net sales were partially offset by a $3.2 million decrease in distributor sales in the JPKO region and a $2.7 million decrease in OEM sales in the Americas region. In addition, Solid Capacitors net sales was unfavorably impacted by $0.5 million from foreign currency exchange due to the change in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe increase in Film and Electrolytic net sales was primarily driven by a $10.5 million increase in distributor sales\n\nacross the Americas and EMEA regions. Also contributing to the increase in net sales was $1.7 million increase in EMS sales in the Americas region and a $0.8 million increase in OEM sales in the JPKO region. These increases in net sales were partially offset by a $5.6 million decrease in OEM sales across the APAC and EMEA regions and a $3.1 million decrease in distributor sales across the APAC and JPKO regions. In addition, there was an unfavorable impact of $0.1 million from foreign currency exchange primarily due to the change in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar.\n\n41\n\n2017\n\n757,338\n\n571,944\n\n107,658\n\n26,693\n\n5,404\n\n10,671\n\n722,370\n\n34,968\n\n(24) 39,755\n\n\u2014 (10,700) (3,871)\n\n9,808\n\n4,294\n\n5,514\n\n41,643\n\n47,157\n\nThe increase in MSA net sales was primarily driven by a $15.0 million increase in OEM sales in the JPKO region.

It also includes travel expenses, professionalservices for marketing activities, and amortization of certain acquired intangibles.The $6.6 million increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to increases of $14.2 million in personnel expenses due to higher headcount tosell our products and $1.4 million due to the amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease of $9.4 million due to the change in accounting forcommission costs under ASC 606. Under ASC 606, certain commissions are capitalized when earned and expensed over the anticipated period of time that goodsand services are expected to be provided to a customer, which we estimate to be approximately five years.Our sales and marketing headcount was 354 as of July 31, 2019 compared with 329 as of July 31, 2018.We expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in sales and marketing activities to supportour business growth and objectives.General and AdministrativeOur general and administrative expenses include executive, finance, human resources, legal, and corporate development and strategy functions, andprimarily consist of personnel costs, as well as professional services.The $1.5 million decrease in our general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease in professional services of $10.2 million,partially offset by increases of $6.1 million in personnel expenses due to higher headcount and $2.5 million in software and cloud infrastructure costs to supportour growth. Professional services were higher in the prior year period as a result of professional services incurred in connection with our acquisition of Cyence andimplementation costs of a new enterprise resource planning platform and a new product configuration and quoting system.Our general and administrative headcount was 298 as of July 31, 2019 compared with 255 as of July 31, 2018. General and administrative headcountincludes personnel in information technology support, information security, and facilities, which are allocated across all functional departments.We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in personnel, corporate infrastructure, andsystems required to support our strategic initiatives, the growth of our business, and our compliance and reporting obligations.Other Income (Expense) Fiscal years ended July 31, 20192018 Change Amount Amount ($) (%) (In thousands, except percentages)Interest income$30,182 $13,281 16,901 127Interest expense$(17,334) $(6,442) (10,892) 169Other income (expense), net$(1,867) $509 (2,376) (467)Interest IncomeInterest income represents interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and investments."],"14":["Statements of Cash Flows\n\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow related activities (in thousands):\n\nYears Ended December 31, 2018\n\n2019\n\n2017\n\nCash (used in) provided by:\n\nOperating activities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, consisting of net loss of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $26.2 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $16.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $10.0 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an outflow from the changes in accrued liabilities and other of $5.9 million and inventory of $5.6 million, partially offset by an inflow from changes in deferred revenue of $3.2 million.\n\nThe unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and other was driven by an increase in lease liabilities associated with the lease of the San Jose corporate office. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to build up of inventory and timing of shipments, partially offset by increased reserves. The favorable change in deferred revenues was primarily driven by increased bookings.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million, consisting of net loss of $27.6 million which includes payments for our internal investigation costs of $8.6 million, non-cash charges of $25.0 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.9 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $3.1 million, offset primarily by an outflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $6.1 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and inventory of $1.5 million.\n\nThe favorable change in deferred revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the sale of subscription and support. The favorable change in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, increased value added tax accrual due to timing of payments, and an increase in legal fees accrual. The unfavorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections. The unfavorable change in prepaid and other assets was mainly driven by the increase in deferred sales commissions due to higher deferred revenue and higher average commission rate. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to the timing of shipments.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $14.3 million, consisting of a net loss of $10.8 million, a cash decrease resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million and non-cash charges of $26.4 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $17.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance of $1.1 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $12.4 million and deferred revenue of $3.0 million, and an outflow from the change in accrued liabilities of $8.9 million, inventory of $4.7 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and accounts payable of $0.9 million.\n\n","PART II\n\nSummary of Cash Flows\n\nThe following table summarizes cash flow information for the periods presented:\n\nYear Ended\n\nJanuary 3, 2020\n\nDecember 28, 2018\n\nDecember 29, 2017\n\n(in millions)\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n\n$\n\n992 $\n\n768 $\n\n526\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n\n65\n\n(114)\n\n(71)\n\nNet cash used in financing activities\n\n(709)\n\n(707)\n\n(429)\n\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n\n$\n\n348 $\n\n(53) $\n\n26\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $224 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to more favorable timing of working capital changes including higher advance payments from customers, $59 million received for the Greek arbitration award and lower payments for integration and restructuring costs. These activities were partially offset by higher tax payments, the timing of interest payments and $60 million of proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps in the prior year.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $242 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to lower payments for taxes, integration and restructuring costs and proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps. This was partially offset by $24 million of cash paid related to the 2016 acquisition of Lockheed Martin's Information Systems & Global Solutions business (\"IS&GS Business\").\n\nNet cash provided by investing activities increased $179 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to $178 million of proceeds received for the dispositions of our commercial cybersecurity and health staff augmentation businesses, $96 million of proceeds received for the sale of real estate properties and $81 million of cash paid in the prior year related to our 2016 acquisition. These activities were partially offset by $94 million of cash paid related to the acquisition of IMX, higher purchases of property, equipment and software and lower proceeds from promissory notes.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $43 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to $81 million of cash paid related to the 2016 acquisition of the IS&GS Business, partially offset by $40 million of proceeds from the settlement of a promissory note.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $2 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to the timing of debt payments and higher stock repurchases, partially offset by $23 million of cash paid related to a tax indemnification in the prior year and the timing of issuances of stock.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $278 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to $250 million of stock repurchases under the ASR program, $167 million of open market stock repurchases and $23 million of cash paid related to a tax indemnification liability. This was partially offset by $150 million of lower debt payments and $14 million of proceeds received from a real estate financing transaction.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe have outstanding performance guarantees and cross-indemnity agreements in connection with certain aspects of our business. We also have letters of credit outstanding principally related to performance guarantees on contracts and surety bonds outstanding principally related to performance and subcontractor payment bonds as described in \"Note 26\u2014Commitments\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

This is primarily attributed to $11.9 million in development of proprietary software and $4.2 million for purchase of property and equipment, including internal use software offset by $2.2 million in proceeds from corporate owned life insurance policies.\n\nCash flow used in financing activities. Respectively, in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, the $0.8 million, $1.3 million, and $0.8 million cash flows used in financing activities were primarily comprised of the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding and to cover the exercise price of the options, and payments on capital lease obligations.\n\nInvestments\n\nInvestments in Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies\n\nAgilysys invests in corporate-owned life insurance policies for certain former executives, for which some are endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements. We entered into non-cancelable agreements with each of the former executives, whereby we must maintain the life insurance policy for a specified amount and split a portion of the policy benefits with their designated beneficiary.

In connection with this exercise, $11 million in cash was received from employees and the company realized a tax benefit of $2 million.\n\nIBM Employees Stock Purchase Plan The company maintains a non-compensatory Employees Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP enables eligible participants to purchase shares of IBM common stock at a 5 percent discount off the average market price on the day of purchase through payroll deductions of up to 10 percent of eligible compensation. Eligible compensation includes any compensation received by the employee during the year. The ESPP provides for semi-annual offering periods during which shares may be purchased and continues as long as shares remain available under the ESPP, unless terminated earlier at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Individual ESPP participants are restricted from purchasing more than $25,000 of common stock in one calendar year or 1,000 shares in an offering period.\n\nEmployees purchased approximately 1.0 million shares under the ESPP during each year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Cash dividends declared and paid by the company on its common stock also include cash dividends on the company stock purchased through the ESPP. Dividends are paid on full and fractional shares and can be reinvested. The company stock purchased through the ESPP is considered outstanding and is included in the weighted-average outstanding shares for purposes of computing basic and diluted earnings per share.\n\nApproximately 18.8 million shares were available for purchase under the ESPP at December 31, 2019.\n\nThe company settles employee stock option exercises primarily with newly issued common shares and, occasionally, with treasury shares. Total treasury shares held at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were approximately 1,351 million and 1,341 million shares, respectively."],"16":["The following table shows summary financial performance for the Group:\n\n$ million\n\n2019\n\n2018 Change (%)\n\nOrder intake1\n\n532.0\n\n470.0\n\n13.2\n\nRevenue\n\n503.6\n\n476.9\n\n5.6\n\nGross profit\n\n368.6\n\n344.5\n\n7.0\n\nGross margin (%)\n\n73.2\n\n72.2\n\n1.0\n\nAdjusted operating costs2\n\n275.7\n\n267.4\n\n3.1\n\nAdjusted operating profit2\n\n92.9\n\n77.1\n\n20.5\n\nAdjusted operating margin3 (%)\n\n18.4\n\n16.2\n\n2.2\n\nReported operating profit\n\n88.6\n\n57.5\n\n54.1\n\nEffective tax rate4 (%)\n\n13.0\n\n15.4\n\n(2.4)\n\nReported profit before tax\n\n89.6\n\n61.2\n\n46.4\n\nAdjusted basic earnings per share5 (cents)\n\n13.40\n\n10.86\n\n23.4\n\nBasic earnings per share (cents)\n\n12.79\n\n9.14\n\n39.9\n\nFree cash flow6\n\n100.1\n\n50.9\n\n96.7\n\nClosing cash\n\n183.2\n\n121.6\n\n50.7\n\nFinal dividend per share7 (cents)\n\n3.45\n\n2.73\n\n26.4\n\nNotes 1.

These APMs are not defined under IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with similarly identified measures used by other companies. The APMs adopted by the Group are defined on pages 190 and 191. The APMs which relate to adjusted income statement lines are presented and reconciled to GAAP measures using a columnar approach on the face of the income statement and can be identified by the prefix \u201cadjusted\u201d in the commentary. All APMs are clearly identified as such, with explanatory footnotes to the tables of financial information provided, and reconciled to reported GAAP measures in the Financial review or Notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nRevenue\n\n$ million\n\n2019 % of total\n\n2018 % of total\n\nRevenue by segment\n\nNetworks & Security\n\n319.9\n\n63.5\n\n285.1\n\n59.8\n\nLifecycle Service Assurance\n\n111.2\n\n22.1\n\n112.8\n\n23.6\n\nConnected Devices\n\n72.5\n\n14.4\n\n79.0\n\n16.6\n\n503.6\n\n100.0\n\n476.9\n\n100.0\n\nRevenue by geography\n\nAmericas\n\n266.1\n\n52.8\n\n265.4\n\n55.7\n\nAsia Pacific\n\n187.8\n\n37.3\n\n159.1\n\n33.3\n\nEurope, Middle East and Africa\n\n49.7\n\n9.9\n\n52.4\n\n11.0\n\n503.6\n\n100.0\n\n476.9\n\n100.0\n\nSpirent Communications plc Annual Report 2019\n\n","28 | 2020 Proxy Statement"," Revenue from installation services is recognized when the services have been completed or transferred as this is when the customer has obtained control.\n\nThe Company has contracts with multiple performance obligations.

Credit Facility\n\nIn November 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the \u2018\u20182016 Credit Facility\u2019\u2019) with Silicon Valley Bank (\u2018\u2018SVB\u2019\u2019) as the lender. The 2016 Credit Facility provided a three-year, $25.0 million revolving credit facility, which included a maximum of $25.0 million letter of credit subfacility. Loan advances under the revolving facility were available of up to the full $25.0 million when the balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities minus outstanding revolving loans and letters of credit equaled or exceeded $50.0 million. If our net cash fell below $50.0 million, loan advances were determined based on a borrowing base equal to a specified percentage of the value of our eligible accounts receivable. Loans bore interest, at our option, at (i) the prime rate reported in The Wall Street Journal, minus 0.50% or (ii) a LIBOR rate determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility, plus 2.50%. Over the term of the 2016 Credit Facility, we paid customary closing fees, commitment fees and letter of credit fees for a facility of this size and type.\n\nIn September 2018, we entered into an amendment with SVB to reduce the unused revolving credit facility fee\n\non the 2016 Credit Facility from 0.4% to 0.3%.\n\nOur obligations under the 2016 Credit Facility were secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property. The 2016 Credit Facility required us to maintain compliance with customary affirmative and negative covenants, including compliance with an adjusted quick ratio of not less than 1.50:1.00, as determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility and restricted our ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions on our capital stock.\n\nOn November 1, 2019, the maturity date, we elected to allow the 2016 Credit Facility to expire without renewal. There were no outstanding loans or advances as of the maturity date. We currently have no plans for entering into a new borrowing facility.\n\n"],"19":["Statements of Cash Flows\n\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow related activities (in thousands):\n\nYears Ended December 31, 2018\n\n2019\n\n2017\n\nCash (used in) provided by:\n\nOperating activities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, consisting of net loss of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $26.2 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $16.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $10.0 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an outflow from the changes in accrued liabilities and other of $5.9 million and inventory of $5.6 million, partially offset by an inflow from changes in deferred revenue of $3.2 million.\n\nThe unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and other was driven by an increase in lease liabilities associated with the lease of the San Jose corporate office. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to build up of inventory and timing of shipments, partially offset by increased reserves. The favorable change in deferred revenues was primarily driven by increased bookings.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million, consisting of net loss of $27.6 million which includes payments for our internal investigation costs of $8.6 million, non-cash charges of $25.0 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.9 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $3.1 million, offset primarily by an outflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $6.1 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and inventory of $1.5 million.\n\nThe favorable change in deferred revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the sale of subscription and support. The favorable change in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, increased value added tax accrual due to timing of payments, and an increase in legal fees accrual. The unfavorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections. The unfavorable change in prepaid and other assets was mainly driven by the increase in deferred sales commissions due to higher deferred revenue and higher average commission rate. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to the timing of shipments.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $14.3 million, consisting of a net loss of $10.8 million, a cash decrease resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million and non-cash charges of $26.4 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $17.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance of $1.1 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $12.4 million and deferred revenue of $3.0 million, and an outflow from the change in accrued liabilities of $8.9 million, inventory of $4.7 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and accounts payable of $0.9 million.\n\n","operations and our ability to manage costs and working capital successfully. Additionally, our cash flow generation ability is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs. Further, our capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned if, for example, our revenues do not reach expected levels, or we have to incur unforeseen capital expenditures and make investments to maintain our competitive position. If this is the case, we may seek alternative financing, such as selling additional debt or equity securities, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on favorable terms, if at all. Moreover, if we issue new debt securities, the debt holders would have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. If we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities, existing stockholders may experience dilution, and such new securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms and conditions of additional financings unattractive. Our inability to raise capital could impede our growth or otherwise require us to forego growth opportunities and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our working capital:\n\nFor the Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n(Dollars in thousands)\n\nCash and cash equivalents Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts Inventories, net Prepaid expenses Other current assets Accounts payable Accrued expenses Current operating lease liabilities Total Working Capital\n\n9,472 18,581 12,542 3,276 10,453 (18,668) (22,133) (1,185) 12,338 $\n\n$\n\nWorking Capital consists of current assets net of current liabilities. Working capital decreased $0.4 million to $12.3 million at December 31, 2019 compared with $12.7 million at December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily a result of an increase of cash, accounts receivable, and inventory offset by an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and current operating lease liabilities.\n\nWe normally carry three to four weeks of finished goods inventory. The average duration of our accounts receivable is approximately 25 days.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 our capital resources consisted of primarily $9.5 million cash on hand and $33.0 million available under our credit facilities, net of $2.0 million reserved for two letters of credit. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our capital resources consisted primarily of $7.5 million cash on hand and $30.0 million available under our credit facilities. The Credit Facilities will mature in May 2024.\n\nWe borrowed $72.3 million under our credit facilities during 2019, of which $18.5 million was repaid prior to the end of the year. As of December 31, 2019, we had $54.5 million of debt outstanding (including $0.7 million of debt issuance costs) under our credit facilities. There was no debt outstanding under the credit facilities as of December 31, 2018.\n\n35\n\n","PART II\n\nSummary of Cash Flows\n\nThe following table summarizes cash flow information for the periods presented:\n\nYear Ended\n\nJanuary 3, 2020\n\nDecember 28, 2018\n\nDecember 29, 2017\n\n(in millions)\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n\n$\n\n992 $\n\n768 $\n\n526\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n\n65\n\n(114)\n\n(71)\n\nNet cash used in financing activities\n\n(709)\n\n(707)\n\n(429)\n\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n\n$\n\n348 $\n\n(53) $\n\n26\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $224 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to more favorable timing of working capital changes including higher advance payments from customers, $59 million received for the Greek arbitration award and lower payments for integration and restructuring costs. These activities were partially offset by higher tax payments, the timing of interest payments and $60 million of proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps in the prior year.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $242 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to lower payments for taxes, integration and restructuring costs and proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps. This was partially offset by $24 million of cash paid related to the 2016 acquisition of Lockheed Martin's Information Systems & Global Solutions business (\"IS&GS Business\").\n\nNet cash provided by investing activities increased $179 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to $178 million of proceeds received for the dispositions of our commercial cybersecurity and health staff augmentation businesses, $96 million of proceeds received for the sale of real estate properties and $81 million of cash paid in the prior year related to our 2016 acquisition. These activities were partially offset by $94 million of cash paid related to the acquisition of IMX, higher purchases of property, equipment and software and lower proceeds from promissory notes.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $43 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to $81 million of cash paid related to the 2016 acquisition of the IS&GS Business, partially offset by $40 million of proceeds from the settlement of a promissory note.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $2 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to the timing of debt payments and higher stock repurchases, partially offset by $23 million of cash paid related to a tax indemnification in the prior year and the timing of issuances of stock.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $278 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to $250 million of stock repurchases under the ASR program, $167 million of open market stock repurchases and $23 million of cash paid related to a tax indemnification liability. This was partially offset by $150 million of lower debt payments and $14 million of proceeds received from a real estate financing transaction.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe have outstanding performance guarantees and cross-indemnity agreements in connection with certain aspects of our business. We also have letters of credit outstanding principally related to performance guarantees on contracts and surety bonds outstanding principally related to performance and subcontractor payment bonds as described in \"Note 26\u2014Commitments\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These arrangements have not had, and management does not believe it is likely that they will in the future have, a material effect on our liquidity, capital resources, operations or financial condition.\n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc."],"20":["DIVESTITURES\n\nSmartphone Modem Business\n\nOn December 2, 2019, we completed the divestiture of the majority of our smartphone modem business, including certain employees, IP, equipment, and leases.

We recognized a pre-tax gain of $690 million on the divestiture.\n\nWind River\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, we completed the divestiture of Wind River and recognized a pre-tax gain of $494 million.\n\nIntel Security Group\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2017, we closed the transaction with TPG VII Manta Holdings, L.P., now known as Manta Holdings, L.P., transferring certain assets and liabilities relating to ISecG to a newly formed, jointly owned, separate cybersecurity company called McAfee. As of the transaction close date, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $387 million within Interest and other, net, which is net of $507 million of currency translation adjustment losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) associated with currency charges on the carrying values of ISecG goodwill and identified intangible assets.

As of April 27, 2019 and April 28, 2018, capital expenditures recorded in accounts payable totaled $6.4 million and $9.0 million, respectively.\n\nIncome Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting\n\nand tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cU.S. Tax Reform\u201d) includes a new global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cGILTI\u201d)\n\nprovision which requires the Company to include foreign subsidiary earnings in its U.S. tax return starting in fiscal 2019. The FASB Staff Q&A, Topic 740 No. 5, \"Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income,\" states that an entity can make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse in future years or provide for the tax expense in the year the tax is incurred. The Company has elected to recognize the tax on GILTI as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred and therefore has not included any deferred tax impacts of GILTI in its consolidated financial statements for its fiscal year ended April 27, 2019.\n\nRevenue Recognition. On April 29, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606,\n\n\u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d using the modified retrospective transition method. Under the new standard, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard was recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. In accordance with the modified retrospective transition method, the historical information within the financial statements has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standard in effect for those periods. As a result, the Company has disclosed the accounting policies in effect prior to April 29, 2018, as well as the policies it has applied starting April 29, 2018. See Note 2, \"Revenue,\" for further details.\n\nPeriods prior to April 29, 2018\n\nRevenue was recognized in accordance with ASC 605, \"Revenue Recognition.\" Revenue was recognized upon either\n\nshipment or delivery (depending on shipping terms) of product to customers and is recorded net of returns, allowances, customer discounts, and incentives. Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities were accounted for on a net (excluded from revenues) basis.\n\nPeriods commencing on or after April 29, 2018\n\nThe majority of the Company's revenue is recognized at a point in time. The Company has determined that the most\n\ndefinitive demonstration that control has transferred to a customer is physical shipment or delivery, depending on the contractual shipping terms, with the exception of consignment transactions. Consignment transactions are arrangements where the Company transfers product to a customer location but retains ownership and control of such product until it is used by the customer. Revenue for consignment arrangements is recognized upon the customer\u2019s usage.\n\nF-10\n\nApril 28, 2018\n\n0.8\n\n69.2\n\n364.7\n\n434.7\n\n272.5\n\n162."],"23":["Table of Contents\n\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated net revenues disaggregated by product group are presented in Note 19.

Additionally, our cash flow generation ability is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs. Further, our capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned if, for example, our revenues do not reach expected levels, or we have to incur unforeseen capital expenditures and make investments to maintain our competitive position. If this is the case, we may seek alternative financing, such as selling additional debt or equity securities, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on favorable terms, if at all. Moreover, if we issue new debt securities, the debt holders would have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. If we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities, existing stockholders may experience dilution, and such new securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms and conditions of additional financings unattractive. Our inability to raise capital could impede our growth or otherwise require us to forego growth opportunities and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our working capital:\n\nFor the Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n(Dollars in thousands)\n\nCash and cash equivalents Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts Inventories, net Prepaid expenses Other current assets Accounts payable Accrued expenses Current operating lease liabilities Total Working Capital\n\n9,472 18,581 12,542 3,276 10,453 (18,668) (22,133) (1,185) 12,338 $\n\n$\n\nWorking Capital consists of current assets net of current liabilities.

The increase was primarily due to more favorable timing of working capital changes including higher advance payments from customers, $59 million received for the Greek arbitration award and lower payments for integration and restructuring costs. These activities were partially offset by higher tax payments, the timing of interest payments and $60 million of proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps in the prior year.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $242 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to lower payments for taxes, integration and restructuring costs and proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps. This was partially offset by $24 million of cash paid related to the 2016 acquisition of Lockheed Martin's Information Systems & Global Solutions business (\"IS&GS Business\").\n\nNet cash provided by investing activities increased $179 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to $178 million of proceeds received for the dispositions of our commercial cybersecurity and health staff augmentation businesses, $96 million of proceeds received for the sale of real estate properties and $81 million of cash paid in the prior year related to our 2016 acquisition. These activities were partially offset by $94 million of cash paid related to the acquisition of IMX, higher purchases of property, equipment and software and lower proceeds from promissory notes.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $43 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to $81 million of cash paid related to the 2016 acquisition of the IS&GS Business, partially offset by $40 million of proceeds from the settlement of a promissory note.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $2 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to the timing of debt payments and higher stock repurchases, partially offset by $23 million of cash paid related to a tax indemnification in the prior year and the timing of issuances of stock.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $278 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to $250 million of stock repurchases under the ASR program, $167 million of open market stock repurchases and $23 million of cash paid related to a tax indemnification liability.

In addition, Film and Electrolytic net sales increased by $4.3 million, and MSA net sales increased by $13.8 million.\n\nThe increase in Solid Capacitors net sales was primarily driven by a $111.8 million increase in distributor sales across the Americas, APAC, and EMEA regions. The $111.8 million increase consisted of a $72.8 million increase in Ceramic product line sales and a $39.0 million increase in Tantalum product line sales. Also contributing to the increase in net sales was a $30.6 million increase in OEM sales across the APAC, EMEA, and JPKO regions, and a $28.0 million increase in EMS sales across all regions. These increases in net sales were partially offset by a $3.2 million decrease in distributor sales in the JPKO region and a $2.7 million decrease in OEM sales in the Americas region. In addition, Solid Capacitors net sales was unfavorably impacted by $0.5 million from foreign currency exchange due to the change in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe increase in Film and Electrolytic net sales was primarily driven by a $10.5 million increase in distributor sales\n\nacross the Americas and EMEA regions. Also contributing to the increase in net sales was $1.7 million increase in EMS sales in the Americas region and a $0.8 million increase in OEM sales in the JPKO region. These increases in net sales were partially offset by a $5.6 million decrease in OEM sales across the APAC and EMEA regions and a $3.1 million decrease in distributor sales across the APAC and JPKO regions.

The decrease in the effective income tax rate and the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the recognition of approximately $2.2 billion of a non-recurring tax benefit in connection with the disposition of preferred stock, representing a minority interest in a foreign affiliate in 2019 compared to the non-recurring deferred tax benefit of approximately $2.1 billion, as a result of an internal reorganization of legal entities within the historical Wireless business, which was offset by a goodwill charge that is not deductible for tax purposes in 2018.\n\nThe effective income tax rate for 2018 was 18.3% compared to (48.3)% for 2017. The increase in the effective income tax rate and the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit of $16.8 billion recorded in 2017 for the re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax liabilities at the lower 21% U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, as a result of the enactment of the TCJA on December 22, 2017. In addition, the provision for income taxes for 2018 includes the tax impact of the Media goodwill impairment charge not deductible for tax purposes, offset by the reduction in the statutory U.S federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018 under the TCJA and a non-recurring deferred tax benefit of approximately $2.1 billion as a result of an internal reorganization of legal entities within the historical Wireless business.\n\nIn December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118 to provide guidance for companies that had not completed their accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA. Due to the complexities involved in accounting for the enactment of the TCJA, SAB 118 allowed for a provisional estimate of the impacts of the TCJA in our earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017, as well as up to a one year measurement period that ended on December 22, 2018, for any subsequent adjustments to such provisional estimate. analyzing the effects of any IRS and U.S. Treasury guidance issued, and state tax law changes enacted, within the one year measurement period resulting in no significant adjustments to the $16.8 billion provisional amount recorded in December 2017.\n\nIn 2018, Verizon completed its analysis of the impacts of the TCJA, including\n\n84 verizon."],"27":["Foreign Currency Translation and Transaction Gains and Losses The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the applicable local currency, the Swedish Krona, the Japanese Yen, the South Korean Won and theTaiwan Dollar.

The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects the benefit of approximately $1.1 billion from the re-measurement of deferred taxes as noted above, a $27 million tax expense related to the sale of our colocation business and $32 million tax impact of non-deductible transaction costs related to the Level 3 acquisition.\n\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets\n\nand deferred tax liabilities were as follows:\n\nAs of December 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\nDeferred tax assets\n\nPost-retirement and pension benefit costs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $\n\n1,169\n\n1,111\n\nNet operating loss carryforwards . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n3,167\n\n3,445\n\nOther employee benefits . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n134\n\n162\n\nOther . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n577\n\n553\n\nGross deferred tax assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n5,047\n\n5,271\n\nLess valuation allowance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n(1,319)\n\n(1,331)\n\nNet deferred tax assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n3,728\n\n3,940\n\nDeferred tax liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, primarily due to depreciation differences . . . . . . .\n\n(3,489)\n\n(3,011)\n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n(3,019)\n\n(3,303)\n\nOther . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n\u2014\n\n","2019 Annual Report Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued\n\nThe components of the provision (benefit) for income taxes are as follows:\n\n(dollars in millions)\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nCurrent\n\nFederal\n\n$\n\n518\n\n$ 2,187\n\n$ 3,630\n\nForeign\n\n221\n\n267\n\n200\n\nState and Local\n\n974\n\n741\n\n677\n\nTotal\n\n1,713\n\n3,195\n\n4,507\n\nDeferred\n\nFederal\n\n1,150\n\n175\n\n(14,360)\n\nForeign\n\n(13)\n\n30\n\n(66)\n\nState and Local\n\n95\n\n184\n\n(37)\n\nTotal\n\n1,232\n\n389\n\n(14,463)\n\nTotal income tax provision (benefit)\n\n$\n\n2,945\n\n$ 3,584\n\n$\n\n(9,956)\n\nThe following table shows the principal reasons for the difference between the effective income tax rate and the statutory federal income tax rate:\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nStatutory federal income tax rate\n\n21.0%\n\n21.0%\n\n35.0%\n\nState and local income tax rate, net of federal tax benefits\n\n3.7\n\n3.7\n\n1.6\n\nPreferred stock disposition\n\n(9.9)\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\nAffordable housing credit\n\n(0.4)\n\n(0.6)\n\n(0.6)\n\nEmployee benefits including ESOP dividend\n\n(0.3)\n\n(0.3)\n\n(0.5)\n\nImpact of tax reform re-measurement\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n(81.6)\n\nInternal restructure\n\n\u2014\n\n(9.1)\n\n(0.6)\n\nNoncontrolling interests\n\n(0.5)\n\n(0.5)\n\n(0.6)\n\nNon-deductible goodwill\n\n0.1\n\n4.7\n\n1.0\n\nOther, net\n\n(0.7)\n\n(0.6)\n\n(2.0)\n\nEffective income tax rate\n\n13.0%\n\n18.3%\n\n(48.3)%\n\nThe effective income tax rate for 2019 was 13.0% compared to 18.3% for 2018. The decrease in the effective income tax rate and the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the recognition of approximately $2.2 billion of a non-recurring tax benefit in connection with the disposition of preferred stock, representing a minority interest in a foreign affiliate in 2019 compared to the non-recurring deferred tax benefit of approximately $2.1 billion, as a result of an internal reorganization of legal entities within the historical Wireless business, which was offset by a goodwill charge that is not deductible for tax purposes in 2018.\n\nThe effective income tax rate for 2018 was 18.3% compared to (48.3)% for 2017. The increase in the effective income tax rate and the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit of $16.8 billion recorded in 2017 for the re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax liabilities at the lower 21% U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, as a result of the enactment of the TCJA on December 22, 2017. In addition, the provision for income taxes for 2018 includes the tax impact of the Media goodwill impairment charge not deductible for tax purposes, offset by the reduction in the statutory U.S federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018 under the TCJA and a non-recurring deferred tax benefit of approximately $2.1 billion as a result of an internal reorganization of legal entities within the historical Wireless business.\n\nIn December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118 to provide guidance for companies that had not completed their accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA. Due to the complexities involved in accounting for the enactment of the TCJA, SAB 118 allowed for a provisional estimate of the impacts of the TCJA in our earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017, as well as up to a one year measurement period that ended on December 22, 2018, for any subsequent adjustments to such provisional estimate. analyzing the effects of any IRS and U.S. Treasury guidance issued, and state tax law changes enacted, within the one year measurement period resulting in no significant adjustments to the $16.8 billion provisional amount recorded in December 2017.\n\nIn 2018, Verizon completed its analysis of the impacts of the TCJA, including\n\n84 verizon.","Table of Contents\n\nSignificant components of the Company\u2019s deferred tax liabilities and assets were as follows:\n\nJune 1, 2019\n\nJune 2, 2018\n\nDeferred tax liabilities:\n\nProperty, plant and equipment Inventories Investment in affiliates Other comprehensive income Other\n\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n\n$\n\n49,275 $ 27,750 7,609 324 2,596 87,554\n\n47,899 25,494 7,996 \u2014 1,616 83,005\n\nDeferred tax assets: Accrued expenses State operating loss carryforwards Other comprehensive loss Other\n\nTotal deferred tax assets Net deferred tax liabilities\n\n$\n\n2,170 133 \u2014 2,654 4,957 82,597 $\n\n3,013 566 95 3,276 6,950 76,055\n\nThe differences between income tax expense (benefit) at the Company\u2019s effective income tax rate and income tax expense at the statutory federal income tax rate were as follows:\n\nFiscal year end\n\nJune 1, 2019\n\nJune 2, 2018\n\nJune 3, 2017\n\nStatutory federal income tax (benefit)\n\nState income tax (benefit)\n\nDomestic manufacturers deduction\n\nEnacted rate change\n\nTax exempt interest income\n\nOther, net\n\n$\n\n$\n\n14,694\n\n2,164\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014 (197) (918) 15,743\n\n$\n\n$\n\n34,105\n\n$\n\n3,200 (2,545) (42,973) (101) (545) (8,859) $\n\n(39,950) (3,193) 4,095\n\n\u2014 (206) (613) (39,867)\n\nIn December 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cAct\u201d), which among other matters reduced the United States corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. In fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a $43 million tax benefit primarily related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nFederal and state income taxes of $36.5 million, $2.1 million, and $3.7 million were paid in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Federal and state income taxes of $418,000, $47.2 million, and $17.6 million were refunded in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\n\nThe Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company measures the tax benefits recognized based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.

Contingencies\n\nFinancial Instruments\n\nThe Company maintained standby letters of credit (\u201cLOC\u201d) with banks totaling $4.2 million at June 1, 2019, of which $3.7 million where issued under the Company's Revolving Credit Facility with the remainder collateralized with cash. The cash collateralized LOCs are included in the line item \u201cOther assets\u201d in the consolidated balance sheets. The outstanding LOCs are for the benefit of certain insurance companies. None of the LOCs are recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nEgg Antitrust Litigation\n\nOn September 25, 2008, the Company was named as one of several defendants in numerous antitrust cases involving the United States shell egg industry. The cases were consolidated into In re: Processed Egg Products Antitrust Litigation, No. 2:08-md-02002-GP, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the \u201cDistrict Court\u201d), in three groups of cases - the \u201cDirect Purchaser Putative Class Action\u201d, the \u201cIndirect Purchaser Putative Class Action\u201d and the \u201cNon-Class Cases.\u201d\n\nThe Direct Purchaser Putative Class Action. The named plaintiffs in these cases alleged that they purchased eggs or egg products directly from a defendant and sued on behalf of themselves and a putative class of others who claimed to be similarly situated. As previously reported, in November 2014, the District Court approved the Company\u2019s settlement with the direct purchaser plaintiff class and entered final judgment dismissing with prejudice the class members\u2019 claims against the Company.\n\nThe Indirect Purchaser Putative Class Action. The named plaintiffs in these cases are individuals or companies who allege that they purchased shell eggs indirectly from one or more of the defendants - that is, they purchased from retailers that had previously purchased from defendants or other parties - and sued on behalf of themselves and a putative class of others who claim to be similarly situated. The District Court denied the indirect purchaser plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification. On June 28, 2018, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the indirect purchaser plaintiffs, for an immaterial amount, and on July 17, 2018, the Court entered an order dismissing all indirect purchaser plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the Company and other defendants.\n\nThe Non-Class Cases. In the remaining cases, the named plaintiffs allege that they purchased shell eggs and egg products directly from one or more of the defendants but sue only for their own alleged damages and not on behalf of a putative class. On April 4, 2018, the Court entered a final judgement dismissing all claims against the Company brought by the following non-class plaintiffs: The Kroger Co.; Publix Super Markets, Inc.; SUPERVALU, Inc.; Safeway, Inc.; Albertsons LLC; H.E. Butt Grocery Co.; The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, Inc.; Walgreen Co.; Hy- Vee, Inc.; and Giant Eagle, Inc., with prejudice, pursuant to the Company\u2019s previously announced $80.8 million settlement with the named plaintiffs.\n\nThe Company settled all Non-Class cases except for the claims of certain plaintiffs who sought substantial damages allegedly arising from the purchase of egg products (as opposed to shell eggs). As previously reported, the Company settled all claims brought by one of these plaintiffs, Conopco, Inc. on a confidential basis and for an amount that did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition or results, and on November 21, 2018, the Court entered a final judgment dismissing Conopco\u2019s claims against the Company. The remaining plaintiffs are Kraft Food Global, Inc., General Mills, Inc., Nestle USA, Inc., and The Kellogg Company (\u201cEgg Products Plaintiffs\u201d)."],"32":["7.

Taxation\n\nThis note explains how our Group tax charge arises. The deferred tax section of the note also provides information on our expected future tax charges and sets out the tax assets held across the Group together with our view on whether or not we expect to be able to make use of these in the future.\n\nAccounting policies Income tax expense represents the sum of the current and deferred taxes.\n\nCurrent tax payable or recoverable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because some items of income or expense are taxable or deductible in different years or may never be taxable or deductible. The Group\u2019s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.\n\nThe Group recognises provisions for uncertain tax positions when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and management judge that it is probable that there will be a future outflow of economic benefits from the Group to settle the obligation. Uncertain tax positions are assessed and measured on an issue by issue basis within the jurisdictions that we operate using management\u2019s estimate of the most likely outcome. The Group recognises interest on late paid taxes as part of financing costs, and any penalties, if applicable, as part of the income tax expense.\n\nDeferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in the future arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. It is accounted for using the statement of financial position liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that temporary differences or taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.\n\nSuch assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised to the extent they arise from the initial recognition of non-tax deductible goodwill.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint arrangements, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting period date and adjusted to reflect changes in the Group\u2019s assessment that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.\n\nTax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they either relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities which intend to settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\n\nTax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the tax is recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity.\n\nIncome tax expense\n\n2019 \u20acm\n\n2018 \u20acm\n\nUnited Kingdom corporation tax expense\/(credit):\n\nCurrent year1 Adjustments in respect of prior years\n\n21 (9) 12\n\n70 (5) 65\n\nOverseas current tax expense\/(credit):\n\nCurrent year Adjustments in respect of prior years\n\nTotal current tax expense\n\n1,098 (48) 1,050 1,062\n\n1,055 (102) 953 1,018\n\nDeferred tax on origination and reversal of temporary differences:\n\nUnited Kingdom deferred tax Overseas deferred tax\n\nTotal deferred tax expense\/(credit) Total income tax expense\/(credit)\n\n(232) 666 434 1,496\n\n39 (1,936) (1,897) (879)\n\nNote: 1 The income statement tax charge includes tax relief on capitalised interest.\n\nUK operating profits are more than offset by statutory allowances for capital investment in the UK network and systems plus ongoing interest costs including those arising from the \u20ac10.3 billion of spectrum payments to the UK government in 2000 and 2013.\n\n2017 \u20acm\n\n27 (3) 24\n\n961 (35) 926 950\n\n","Table of Contents\n\nDifferences between income taxes calculated using the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, 26.9% in the fiscalyear ended July 31, 2018, and 35% in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017 and the provision for income taxes are as follows (in thousands): Fiscal years ended July 31, 2019 2018 2017Statutory federal income tax$2,617 $(2,224) $9,984State taxes, net of federal benefit(939) (993) 806Share-based compensation(8,013) (8,715) 2,517Non-deductible officers' compensation3,938 3,230 959Foreign income taxed at different rates203 1,022 (819)Research tax credits(6,943) (5,822) (2,377)Re-measurement of U.S. deferred taxes\u2014 36,125 \u2014Non-deductible acquisition costs\u2014 1,270 270Domestic production activity deduction\u2014 \u2014 (1,370)Permanent differences and others918 666 484Change in valuation allowance(61) (6,092) \u2014Total provision for (benefit from) income taxes$(8,280) $18,467 $10,454The tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in thousands): As of July 31, 2019 2018Accruals and reserves$7,870 $12,129Stock-based compensation6,353 7,658Deferred revenue2,316 4,023Property and equipment\u2014 1,268Net operating loss carryforwards55,881 56,668Tax credits74,819 60,450Total deferred tax assets147,239 142,196Less valuation allowance31,421 28,541Net deferred tax assets115,818 113,655Less deferred tax liabilities: Intangible assets7,413 11,461Convertible debt10,274 11,567Property and equipment1,435 \u2014Unremitted foreign earnings302 258Capitalized commissions6,086 \u2014Total deferred tax liabilities25,510 23,286Deferred tax assets, net90,308 90,369Less foreign deferred revenue\u2014 69Less foreign capitalized commissions906 \u2014Total net deferred tax assets89,402 90,300The Company considered both positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxableincome, tax planning strategies, historic book profit\/loss, prior taxable income\/loss, and results of future operations, and determined that a valuation allowance wasnot required for a significant portion of its deferred tax assets.

Taxation\n\nThis note explains how our Group tax charge arises. The deferred tax section of the note also provides information on our expected future tax charges and sets out the tax assets held across the Group together with our view on whether or not we expect to be able to make use of these in the future.\n\nAccounting policies Income tax expense represents the sum of the current and deferred taxes.\n\nCurrent tax payable or recoverable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because some items of income or expense are taxable or deductible in different years or may never be taxable or deductible. The Group\u2019s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.\n\nThe Group recognises provisions for uncertain tax positions when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and management judge that it is probable that there will be a future outflow of economic benefits from the Group to settle the obligation. Uncertain tax positions are assessed and measured on an issue by issue basis within the jurisdictions that we operate using management\u2019s estimate of the most likely outcome. The Group recognises interest on late paid taxes as part of financing costs, and any penalties, if applicable, as part of the income tax expense.\n\nDeferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in the future arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. It is accounted for using the statement of financial position liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that temporary differences or taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.\n\nSuch assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised to the extent they arise from the initial recognition of non-tax deductible goodwill.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint arrangements, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting period date and adjusted to reflect changes in the Group\u2019s assessment that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.\n\nTax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they either relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities which intend to settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\n\nTax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the tax is recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity.\n\nIncome tax expense\n\n2019 \u20acm\n\n2018 \u20acm\n\nUnited Kingdom corporation tax expense\/(credit):\n\nCurrent year1 Adjustments in respect of prior years\n\n21 (9) 12\n\n70 (5) 65\n\nOverseas current tax expense\/(credit):\n\nCurrent year Adjustments in respect of prior years\n\nTotal current tax expense\n\n1,098 (48) 1,050 1,062\n\n1,055 (102) 953 1,018\n\nDeferred tax on origination and reversal of temporary differences:\n\nUnited Kingdom deferred tax Overseas deferred tax\n\nTotal deferred tax expense\/(credit) Total income tax expense\/(credit)\n\n(232) 666 434 1,496\n\n39 (1,936) (1,897) (879)\n\nNote: 1 The income statement tax charge includes tax relief on capitalised interest.\n\nUK operating profits are more than offset by statutory allowances for capital investment in the UK network and systems plus ongoing interest costs including those arising from the \u20ac10.3 billion of spectrum payments to the UK government in 2000 and 2013.\n\n2017 \u20acm\n\n27 (3) 24\n\n961 (35) 926 950\n\n"],"34":["100\n\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n4.3\n\nCONTRIBUTED EQUITY\n\nContributed equity represents the number of ordinary shares on issue less shares held by the Group.

The Company classifies these measurements as Level 2.\n\nNote 7. Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nThe carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value because their maturity is less than three months. Management believes the carrying amount of the equity and cost-method investments materially approximated fair value at March 31, 2019 based upon unobservable inputs. The fair values of these investments have been determined as Level 3 fair value measurements. The fair values of the Company's line of credit borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements and approximate carrying value excluding debt issuance costs. Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities, the fair value of the Company's line of credit borrowings at March 31, 2019 approximated the carrying value and are considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described in Note 6. The carrying amount of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of the amounts and are considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nFair Value of Subordinated Convertible Debt, Senior Secured Notes, and Term Loan Facility\n\nThe Company measures the fair value of its senior and junior subordinated convertible debt and senior secured notes for\n\ndisclosure purposes. These fair values are based on observable market prices for this debt, which is traded in less active markets and are therefore classified as a Level 2 fair value measurement.\n\nThe following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's senior and junior subordinated\n\nconvertible debt, senior secured notes, and term loan facility as of March 31, 2019 and 2018 (in millions).\n\nMarch 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nCarrying Amount\n\nFair Value\n\nCarrying Amount\n\nFair Value\n\n2023 Senior Secured Notes\n\n$\n\n985.4\n\n$\n\n1,020.1\n\nN\/A\n\nN\/A\n\n2021 Senior Secured Notes\n\n$\n\n987.4\n\n$\n\n1,008.1\n\nN\/A\n\nN\/A\n\nTerm Loan Facility\n\n$\n\n1,892.1\n\n$\n\n1,911.5\n\nN\/A\n\nN\/A\n\n2017 Senior Convertible Debt\n\n$\n\n1,493.6\n\n$\n\n2,285.4\n\n$\n\n1,437.6\n\n$\n\n2,459.2\n\n2015 Senior Convertible Debt\n\n$\n\n1,360.8\n\n$\n\n2,810.6\n\n$\n\n1,309.9\n\n$\n\n3,079.1\n\n2017 Junior Convertible Debt\n\n$\n\n335.9\n\n$\n\n740.8\n\n$\n\n326.7\n\n$\n\n876.9\n\n(1) The carrying amounts presented are net of debt discounts and debt issuance costs (see Note 12 Debt and Credit Facility for\n\nfurther information).\n\nNote 8.

Adjusted gross margin represents gross profit plus amortization of acquired intangibles and stock-based compensation. Adjusted gross margin is a measure used by management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to generate future operating plans. The exclusion of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis. In the near term, we expect these expenses to continue to negatively impact our gross profit. Adjusted gross margin is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that adjusted gross margin provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Nevertheless, our use of adjusted gross margin has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. You should consider adjusted gross margin alongside our other GAAP-based financial performance measures, gross profit and our other GAAP financial results.

Net voyage revenues divided by the number of days on the charter provides theTime Charter Equivalent (TCE) Rate. Net voyage revenues and TCE rates are widely used by investors and analysts in the tanker shipping industry for comparing the financialperformance of companies and for preparing industry averages. We believe that our method of calculating net voyage revenue is consistent with industry standards. The table belowreconciles our net voyage revenues to voyage revenues.

The indicative rates presented by Clarksons Shipping increased by 91.7% for the twelve months of 2019compared to the same twelve months in 2018 to $31,560 from $16,466, respectively. The rates presented by Clarksons Shipping were significantly influenced by the spike in the Suezmaxtanker rates in the fourth quarter of both 2019 and 2018. Our average TCE was also positively impacted by the increased tanker rates towards the end of 2019, but not to the same extentas the rates reported by Clarksons Shipping. We expect this spike to materialize to a larger extent in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the rates reported by Clarksons Shipping.As a result of i) and ii) net voyage revenues increased by 41.5% from $124.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to $175.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.Voyage expenses decreased to $141.8 million from $165.0 million, or 14.1%. The decrease in voyage expenses was primarily due to a decrease in vessel calendar days asdiscussed above.Vessel operating expenses decreased by $14.4 million, or 17.9%, from $80.4 million in 2018 to $66.0 million in 2019. This was primarily due to the decrease in our fleet as discussedabove. In cooperation with our technical managers we maintain our focus on keeping the fleet in top technical condition whilst keeping costs low.No impairment loss on vessels has been recorded in 2019 compared to a loss of $2.2 million recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018.General and administrative expenses increased $0.7 million, or 5.9%, from $12.7 million in 2018 to $13.5 million in 2019.Depreciation expenses increased by $3.3 million, or 5.4%, from $60.7 million in 2018 to $64.0 million in 2019. The increase is primarily due to the full-year effect of the threevessels added to the fleet in the latter part of 2018.Interest expenses increased by $3.8 million, or 11.1%, from $34.5 million in 2018 to $38.4 million in 2019. The increase is mainly due to the full year-effect of the loans associatedwith the three vessels added to the fleet in latter part of 2018 and a non-cash expense of about $1.7 million related to the remaining borrowing cost under the Credit Facility that wasrepaid on February 12, 2019.Other financial expenses decreased by $10.6, or 71.4%, from $14.8 million in 2018 to $4.2 million in 2019 mainly due an expense related to fair value change of $3.2 million forInvestment Securities, offset by the cancellation of the Backstop facility in 2018 and expense of the associated fees of $13.4 million.Please see Item 5.

If the oil field no longer produces oil or is abandoned or the contract term is not extended, we will no longer generate revenue under the related contract and will need to seek to redeploy affected vessels. FPSO contracts under which our FPSO units operate are subject to extensions beyond their initial term. The likelihood of these contracts being extended may be negatively affected by reductions in oil field reserves, low oil prices generally or other factors. If we are unable to promptly redeploy any affected vessels at rates at least equal to those under the contracts, if at all, our operating results will be harmed. Any potential redeployment may not be under long-term contracts, which may affect the stability of our cash flow and our ability to make cash distributions. FPSO units, in particular, are specialized vessels that have very limited alternative uses and high fixed costs. In addition, FPSO units typically require substantial capital investments prior to being redeployed to a new field and production service agreement. Any idle time prior to the commencement of a new contract or our inability to redeploy the vessels at acceptable rates may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\n\nWe do not control access to cash flow generated by our investments in equity-accounted joint ventures. We do not have control over the operations of, nor do we have any legal claim to the revenue and expenses of our investments in, our equity-accounted joint ventures. Consequently, the cash flow generated by our investments in equity-accounted joint ventures may not be available for use by us in the period that such cash flows are generated.\n\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe results of operations that follow have first been divided into (a) our controlling interests in our publicly-traded subsidiaries Teekay LNG and Teekay Tankers and (b) Teekay Parent. Within these groups, we have further subdivided the results into their respective lines of business.

As part of our commitment to reduce our Greenhouse Gas (\u2018GHG\u2019) emissions, we moved to a certified green tariff renewable electricity supply contract for our UK operations from the beginning of the financial year.\n\nThe GHG emissions summary below shows our gross emissions including location-based scope 2 emissions, as well as our net emissions accounting for the market-based scope 2 reporting for our certified green electricity tariff.\n\nThe reduction in emissions is driven by continued progress in energy efficiency, a reduction in emissions associated with refrigerants as we continue to move away from fluorinated gas refrigerants, and the general reduction in UK grid carbon factor as more renewables make up a greater proportion of the fuel mix.\n\nReducing packaging and plastics Packaging and plastic have played a vital role in safe food storage and distribution for decades, but now our approach to their use is changing. We work with our customers to look for the best packaging solutions for all our products, that take into account the environmental impact, while keeping our food fresher for longer. We are committed to working with our customers to reducing our use of single-use plastics and partnering with suppliers to find effective alternatives.\n\nWe support the UK Plastics Pact and are committed to meeting its 2025 targets. We will monitor and reduce the amount of plastics used to transport and consume our products, and we aim to develop a circular system whereby plastic is used less and kept out of the environment. Throughout FY19, we have engaged with all key customers and have plans to remove remaining \u2018hard to recycle\u2019 packaging as soon as possible.\n\nOver the last six years, we have made good progress in our water consumption per tonne of product, reducing it by 15% over the period. There was also a significant improvement in FY19, and one of the contributing factors to the improvement was the closure of the Evercreech desserts facility which had a higher water intensity than most sites within the business.\n\nWater consumption per tonne of product \u2013 UK manufacturing (m3 per tonne)\n\nIn FY19, we saved 18.7 tonnes of plastic by replacing the black plastic trays in a ready meal range with foil. Activities targeting relatively small pieces of plastic such as \u2018windows\u2019 on quiche boxes have also led to significant reductions in plastic use.\n\nWe have recycled 758 tonnes of plastic from our manufacturing and distribution activities in FY19 and have identified opportunities for further improvements in the future.\n\nFY19\n\n5.91\n\nFY18\n\n6.45\n\nPrimary energy consumption per tonne of product \u2013 UK manufacturing (kWhp per tonne)\n\nFY19\n\n1,235\n\nFY18\n\n1,299\n\nEmissions are summarised below, all reported as CO2 equivalent (\u2018CO2e\u2019) Emissions from:\n\nEmissions reported in tonnes CO2e* FY19**\n\nFY18**\n\nFY18***\n\nCombustion of fuel and operation of facilities (Scope 1)\n\n59,495\n\n66,336\n\n75,600\n\nElectricity, heat, steam and cooling purchased for own use (Scope 2)\n\n27,633\n\n32,389\n\n67,754\n\nTotal gross emissions (Scope 1 and 2)\n\n87,128\n\n98,725\n\n143,354\n\nGreen tariff\n\n27,603\n\n0\n\n0\n\nTotal net emissions (Scope 1 and 2)\n\n59,525\n\n98,725\n\n143,354\n\nRatio (KgCO2e per \u00a31 sales revenue)\n\n0.060\n\n0.066\n\n0.056\n\nOur GHG emissions have been calculated using the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, and emissions factors from DEFRA\u2019s\n\nUK government GHG conversion factors for company reporting (where factors have not been provided directly by a supplier).\n\n** UK & Ireland only \u2013 comparable with FY19 Group structure. *** Full Group including US business.\n\nAnnual Report and Financial Statements 2019\n\n"," . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $117.5 million and $109.6 million, respectively. The Company also had deferred tax liabilities of $12.3 million and $16.1 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income, if any, the amount and timing of which is uncertain. Based on the available objective evidence, and historical operating performance, management believes that it is more likely than not that all U.S. and certain foreign deferred tax assets are not realizable. Accordingly, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset with a valuation allowance. The net valuation allowance increased by approximately $11.9 million and $10.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $285.9 million which will begin to expire in the year 2020. The Company had state net and foreign operating loss carryforwards of approximately $268.1 million and $24.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has research credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $16.0 million which will begin to expire in the year 2032. The Company also had state net research credit carryforwards for income tax purposes of approximately $18.3 million which can be carried forward indefinitely. The Company also had MAT credit carry forwards for Indian income tax purposes of approximately $0.7 million which will begin to expire in the year 2030.\n\nA reconciliation of the gross unrecognized tax benefit is as follows (in thousands):\n\n2019\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018\n\n2017\n\nUnrecognized tax benefit - beginning balance Increases for tax positions taken in prior years Decreases for tax positions taken in prior years Increases for tax positions taken in current year Unrecognized tax benefit - ending balance\n\n$\n\n$\n\n8,217 $ \u2014 \u2014 623 8,840 $\n\n7,527 $ \u2014 (242) 932 8,217 $\n\n6,447 16 \u2014 1,064 7,527\n\nThe unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would not impact the Company's effective tax rate as the recognition of these tax benefits would\n\nbe offset by changes in the Company's valuation allowance. The Company does not believe there will be any material changes in its unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months.\n\n93\n\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Due to the\n\nCompany\u2019s historical loss position, all tax years from inception through December 31, 2019 remain open due to unutilized net operating losses.\n\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States and various states and foreign jurisdictions and is subject to examination by various taxing authorities including major jurisdiction like the United States. As such, all its net operating loss and research credit carryforwards that may be used in future years are subject to adjustment, if and when utilized.\n\nUtilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change\n\nlimitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before their utilization.\n\n13. Net Income (Loss) per Share\n\nNet Loss per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\n\nThe computation of the Company\u2019s basic and diluted net loss per share is as follows (in thousands, except per share data):\n\n2019\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018\n\nNet loss\n\n$\n\n(37,057)\n\n$\n\n(28,318)\n\n$\n\nWeighted-average number of shares used to compute net loss per share, basic and diluted\n\n91,163\n\n93,676\n\nNet loss per share, basic and diluted\n\n$\n\n(0.41)\n\n$\n\n(0.30)\n\n$\n\nBasic and diluted net loss per share is the same for each period presented, as the inclusion of all potential common shares outstanding would\n\nhave been anti-dilutive.\n\nThe outstanding common equivalent shares excluded from the computation of the diluted net loss per share for the periods presented\n\nbecause including them would have been antidilutive are as follows (in thousands):\n\n2019\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018\n\nStock options and ESPP Restricted stock units Shares held in escrow Shares related to convertible senior notes\n\n8,642 5,023 \u2014 11,521 25,186\n\n6,664 4,904 \u2014 11,521 23,089\n\n14. Leases\n\nThe Company has entered into operating leases primarily for office facilities. These leases have terms which typically range from 1 year\n\nto 5 years, and often include options to renew. These renewal terms can extend the lease term up to 6 years, and are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. Effective January 1, 2019, these operating leases are included as right-of- use assets in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, as a result of the adoption of the new leasing standard as discussed under Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, and represent the Company\u2019s right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The present value of the Company\u2019s obligation to make lease payments are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nBased on the present value of the lease payments for the remaining lease term of the Company's existing leases, the Company recognized 1) right-of-use assets of $8.5 million, adjusted for deferred rent and lease incentives as of the adoption date, and 2) lease liabilities for operating leases of $11.5 million on January 1, 2019.","Table of Contents\n\nSignificant components of the Company\u2019s deferred tax liabilities and assets were as follows:\n\nJune 1, 2019\n\nJune 2, 2018\n\nDeferred tax liabilities:\n\nProperty, plant and equipment Inventories Investment in affiliates Other comprehensive income Other\n\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n\n$\n\n49,275 $ 27,750 7,609 324 2,596 87,554\n\n47,899 25,494 7,996 \u2014 1,616 83,005\n\nDeferred tax assets: Accrued expenses State operating loss carryforwards Other comprehensive loss Other\n\nTotal deferred tax assets Net deferred tax liabilities\n\n$\n\n2,170 133 \u2014 2,654 4,957 82,597 $\n\n3,013 566 95 3,276 6,950 76,055\n\nThe differences between income tax expense (benefit) at the Company\u2019s effective income tax rate and income tax expense at the statutory federal income tax rate were as follows:\n\nFiscal year end\n\nJune 1, 2019\n\nJune 2, 2018\n\nJune 3, 2017\n\nStatutory federal income tax (benefit)\n\nState income tax (benefit)\n\nDomestic manufacturers deduction\n\nEnacted rate change\n\nTax exempt interest income\n\nOther, net\n\n$\n\n$\n\n14,694\n\n2,164\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014 (197) (918) 15,743\n\n$\n\n$\n\n34,105\n\n$\n\n3,200 (2,545) (42,973) (101) (545) (8,859) $\n\n(39,950) (3,193) 4,095\n\n\u2014 (206) (613) (39,867)\n\nIn December 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cAct\u201d), which among other matters reduced the United States corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. In fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a $43 million tax benefit primarily related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nFederal and state income taxes of $36.5 million, $2.1 million, and $3.7 million were paid in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Federal and state income taxes of $418,000, $47.2 million, and $17.6 million were refunded in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\n\nThe Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company measures the tax benefits recognized based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. As of June 1, 2019, there were no uncertain tax positions that resulted in any adjustment to the Company\u2019s provision for income taxes.\n\n57\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe are under audit by the IRS for the fiscal years 2013 through 2015. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions within the U.S., and certain jurisdictions are under audit by state and local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. Tax periods for all years beginning with fiscal year 2013 remain open to examination by federal and state taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject.\n\n12. Contingencies\n\nFinancial Instruments\n\nThe Company maintained standby letters of credit (\u201cLOC\u201d) with banks totaling $4.2 million at June 1, 2019, of which $3.7 million where issued under the Company's Revolving Credit Facility with the remainder collateralized with cash. The cash collateralized LOCs are included in the line item \u201cOther assets\u201d in the consolidated balance sheets. The outstanding LOCs are for the benefit of certain insurance companies. None of the LOCs are recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nEgg Antitrust Litigation\n\nOn September 25, 2008, the Company was named as one of several defendants in numerous antitrust cases involving the United States shell egg industry. The cases were consolidated into In re: Processed Egg Products Antitrust Litigation, No. 2:08-md-02002-GP, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the \u201cDistrict Court\u201d), in three groups of cases - the \u201cDirect Purchaser Putative Class Action\u201d, the \u201cIndirect Purchaser Putative Class Action\u201d and the \u201cNon-Class Cases.\u201d\n\nThe Direct Purchaser Putative Class Action. The named plaintiffs in these cases alleged that they purchased eggs or egg products directly from a defendant and sued on behalf of themselves and a putative class of others who claimed to be similarly situated. As previously reported, in November 2014, the District Court approved the Company\u2019s settlement with the direct purchaser plaintiff class and entered final judgment dismissing with prejudice the class members\u2019 claims against the Company.\n\nThe Indirect Purchaser Putative Class Action. The named plaintiffs in these cases are individuals or companies who allege that they purchased shell eggs indirectly from one or more of the defendants - that is, they purchased from retailers that had previously purchased from defendants or other parties - and sued on behalf of themselves and a putative class of others who claim to be similarly situated. The District Court denied the indirect purchaser plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification. On June 28, 2018, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the indirect purchaser plaintiffs, for an immaterial amount, and on July 17, 2018, the Court entered an order dismissing all indirect purchaser plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the Company and other defendants.\n\nThe Non-Class Cases. In the remaining cases, the named plaintiffs allege that they purchased shell eggs and egg products directly from one or more of the defendants but sue only for their own alleged damages and not on behalf of a putative class. On April 4, 2018, the Court entered a final judgement dismissing all claims against the Company brought by the following non-class plaintiffs: The Kroger Co.; Publix Super Markets, Inc.; SUPERVALU, Inc.; Safeway, Inc.; Albertsons LLC; H.E. Butt Grocery Co.; The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, Inc.; Walgreen Co.; Hy- Vee, Inc.; and Giant Eagle, Inc., with prejudice, pursuant to the Company\u2019s previously announced $80.8 million settlement with the named plaintiffs.\n\nThe Company settled all Non-Class cases except for the claims of certain plaintiffs who sought substantial damages allegedly arising from the purchase of egg products (as opposed to shell eggs). As previously reported, the Company settled all claims brought by one of these plaintiffs, Conopco, Inc. on a confidential basis and for an amount that did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition or results, and on November 21, 2018, the Court entered a final judgment dismissing Conopco\u2019s claims against the Company. The remaining plaintiffs are Kraft Food Global, Inc., General Mills, Inc., Nestle USA, Inc., and The Kellogg Company (\u201cEgg Products Plaintiffs\u201d).","KEMET CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n\nThe components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (amounts in thousands):\n\nMarch 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nDeferred tax assets:\n\nNet operating loss carry forwards\n\n$\n\n78,986\n\n$\n\n115,064\n\nSales allowances and inventory reserves\n\n10,967\n\n9,675\n\nMedical and employee benefits\n\n35,298\n\n38,572\n\nDepreciation and differences in basis\n\n5,318\n\n6,241\n\nAccrued restructuring\n\n469\n\n2,551\n\nAnti-trust fines and settlements\n\n910\n\n16,575\n\nTax credits\n\n3,394\n\n4,208\n\nStock-based compensation Other(1)\n\nTotal deferred tax assets before valuation allowance\n\nLess valuation allowance\n\nTotal deferred tax assets\n\n5,589\n\n1,342 142,273 (58,658) 83,615\n\n1,765\n\n2,812 197,463 (171,401) 26,062\n\nDeferred tax liabilities:\n\nUnremitted earnings of subsidiaries\n\nAmortization of intangibles and debt discounts\n\nNon-amortized intangibles\n\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n\nNet deferred tax assets (liabilities)\n\n$\n\n(21,850) (11,996) (1,551) (35,397) 48,218\n\n$\n\n(11,678) (14,054) (1,551) (27,283) (1,221)\n\n__________________________________________________________________ (1) March 31, 2018 adjusted due to the adoption of ASC 606.\n\nThe following table presents the annual activities included in the deferred tax valuation allowance (amounts in\n\nthousands):\n\nValuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets\n\nBalance at March 31, 2016\n\nCharge (benefit) to costs and expenses\n\nDeductions\n\nBalance at March 31, 2017\n\n$\n\n170,917 (2,094) (4,925) 163,898\n\nCharge to costs and expenses\n\nDeductions\n\nBalance at March 31, 2018\n\nCharge (benefit) to costs and expenses\n\nDeductions\n\nBalance at March 31, 2019\n\n$\n\n8,647 (1,144) 171,401 (112,080) (663) 58,658\n\nIn fiscal year 2019, the valuation allowance decreased $112.7 million, of which $44.9 million related to a valuation allowance decrease for the foreign group and $67.8 million related to a valuation allowance decrease for the U.S. group.

As of May 26, 2019, we had other commercial commitments totaling $5.3 million, of which $3.7 million expire in less than one year and $1.6 million expire in one to three years.\n\nIn addition to the other commercial commitments, as of May 26, 2019, we had $56.4 million of standby letters of credit issued on our behalf. These standby letters of credit are primarily related to our self-insured workers compensation programs and are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nIn certain limited situations, we will guarantee an obligation of an unconsolidated entity. We guarantee certain leases resulting from the divestiture of the JM Swank business completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.

The Group holds 50 per cent beneficial interests in the relevant freehold or leasehold of these properties. Each joint arrangement is governed by a Trust Deed giving each party rights to income and obligations for expenses in respect of their beneficial interest in the property. The management of the property is established under the Trust Deed as being undertaken by an entity jointly controlled by the beneficial owners of the property. This entity does not have the right to a share of the income or expenditure from the property, other than the receipt of a management fee. Therefore these interests are accounted for as joint operations.

Both companies are incorporated in India.\n\nThe equity method of accounting is applied to the Group\u2019s investments in Prozone and Empire in line with the requirements of IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. The results for the year to 30 September have been used as 31 December information is not available in time for these financial statements. Those results are adjusted to be in line with the Group\u2019s accounting policies and include the most recent property valuations, determined at 30 September 2019, by independent professionally qualified external valuers in line with the valuation methodology described in note 13.\n\nThe market price per share of Prozone at 31 December 2019 was INR19 (31 December 2018: INR29), valuing the Group\u2019s interest at \u00a39.9 million (31 December 2018: \u00a316.4 million) compared with the Prozone carrying value pre-impairment of \u00a341.5 million (31 December 2018: \u00a345.1 million). As the share price of Prozone is lower than its carrying value, a review of the carrying value of Prozone and the Group\u2019s direct interest in Empire (as it also forms part of the Prozone group) has been undertaken. Underpinning the impairment assessment (where the fair value less costs to sell was considered) were the independent third-party valuations received for the investment and development properties, representing the underlying value of the associate\u2019s net assets.

(\u201cVerizon\u201d) that currently provides for the lease, sublease or management of approximately 11,250 wireless communications sites commencing March 27, 2015. The average term of the lease or sublease for all sites at the inception of the agreement was approximately 28 years, assuming renewals or extensions of the underlying ground leases for the sites. The Company has the option to purchase the leased sites in tranches, subject to the applicable lease, sublease or management rights upon its scheduled expiration. Each tower is assigned to an annual tranche, ranging from 2034 to 2047, which represents the outside expiration date for the sublease rights to the towers in that tranche. The purchase price for each tranche is a fixed amount stated in the lease for such tranche plus the fair market value of certain alterations made to the related towers. The aggregate purchase option price for the towers leased and subleased is approximately $5.0 billion. Verizon will occupy the sites as a tenant for an initial term of ten years with eight optional successive five-year terms; each such term shall be governed by standard master lease agreement terms established as a part of the transaction.\n\nAT&T Transaction\u2014The Company has an agreement with SBC Communications Inc., a predecessor entity to AT&T, that currently provides for the lease or sublease of approximately 2,200 towers commencing between December 2000 and August 2004.

Contract modifications routinely occur to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. In most cases, contract modifications are for goods or services that are not distinct and, therefore, are accounted for as part of the existing contract. Transaction price estimates include additional consideration for submitted contract modifications or claims when we believe there is an enforceable right to the modification or claim, the amount can be reliably estimated, and its realization is reasonably assured. Amounts representing modifications accounted for as part of the existing contract are included in the transaction price and recognized as an adjustment to sales on a cumulative catch-up basis.\n\nIn addition, we are subject to audits of incurred costs related to many of our U.S. government contracts. These audits could produce different results than we have estimated for revenue recognized on our cost-based contracts with the U.S. government; however, our experience has been that our costs are acceptable to the government.\n\nContract Estimates\n\nUse of the cost-to-cost or other similar methods of revenue recognition requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the revenue and cost associated with the design, manufacture and delivery of our products and services. Revisions or adjustments to estimates of the transaction price, estimated costs at completion and estimated profit or loss of a performance obligation are often required as work progresses under a contract, as experience is gained, as facts and circumstances change and as new information is obtained, even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change. In determining the estimated costs at completion, we have to make assumptions regarding labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, estimated increases in wages and prices for materials, performance by our subcontractors, and the availability and timing of funding from our customer, among other variables. Revisions or adjustments to our estimated transaction price and estimated costs at completion may also be required if contract modifications occur. The revisions in contract estimates, if significant, can materially affect our results of operations and cash flows, and in some cases result in liabilities to complete contracts in a loss position. Based upon our history, we believe we have the ability to make reasonable estimates for these items. We have accounting policies and controls in place to address these, as well as other contractual and business arrangements to properly account for long-term contracts, and we continue to monitor and improve such policies, controls, and arrangements. For other information on such policies, controls and arrangements, see our discussion in Item 9A of this Form 10-K.\n\nProducts and services provided under long-term, fixed-price contracts represented approximately 97% of our sales for 2019. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if our underlying circumstances were to change. For example, if underlying assumptions were to change such that our estimated profit rate at completion for all fixed-price contracts accounted for under the cost-to-cost percentage-of-completion method was higher or lower by one percentage point, our 2019 operating income would have increased or decreased by approximately $6.5 million. When adjustments in estimated contract revenues or estimated costs at completion are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized by recording adjustments in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of the changes on current and prior periods using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period the loss is determined.\n\nThe aggregate impact of net changes in contract estimates are presented in the table below (amounts in thousands).\n\nOperating income (loss) Net income (loss) from continuing operations Diluted earnings per share\n\nYears Ended September 30, 2018\n\n2019\n\n$ (2,235) $ (6,986) $ (5,146) (0.19)\n\n(2,351) (0.08)\n\n2017 5,737 3,208 0.12\n\n"," Revenue from installation services is recognized when the services have been completed or transferred as this is when the customer has obtained control.\n\nThe Company has contracts with multiple performance obligations.

Adjusted gross margin represents gross profit plus amortization of acquired intangibles and stock-based compensation. Adjusted gross margin is a measure used by management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to generate future operating plans. The exclusion of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis. In the near term, we expect these expenses to continue to negatively impact our gross profit. Adjusted gross margin is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that adjusted gross margin provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.

Credit risk arises primarily from trade receivables but also from other financial assets with counterparties including loans to joint ventures, cash deposits and derivative financial instruments.\n\n\u2013 trade receivables Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed; tenants are typically invoiced quarterly in advance and are managed individually by asset managers, who continuously monitor and work with tenants, aiming wherever possible to identify and address risks prior to default.\n\nProspective tenants are assessed via a review process, including obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial information, which is conducted internally. As a result deposits or guarantees may be obtained. The amount of deposits held as collateral at 31 December 2019 is \u00a33.5 million (2018: \u00a33.5 million).\n\nWhen applying a loss allowance for expected credit losses, judgement is exercised as to the collectability of trade receivables and to determine if it is appropriate to impair these assets. When considering expected credit losses, management has taken into account days past due, credit status of the counterparty and historical evidence of collection.\n\nThe ageing analysis of trade receivables is as follows:\n\n\u00a3m\n\n2019\n\nUp to three months\n\n29.9\n\nThree to six months\n\n10.0\n\nTrade receivables\n\n39.9\n\nAt 31 December 2019 trade receivables are shown net of a loss allowance totalling \u00a36.1 million (2018: \u00a34.0 million).\n\nThe Group does not use factoring to generate cash flow from trade receivables.\n\n\u2013 other financial assets including loans to joint ventures The Group applies the expected credit loss model in respect of other financial assets. Financial assets are individually assessed as to whether the credit risk has increased significantly in the period and therefore whether there is a need to apply the lifetime expected credit losses model as opposed to the 12-month expected credit loss model.\n\nAt 31 December 2019 there is no loss allowance recognised for other financial assets as it has been concluded as an immaterial risk of credit loss on other financial assets.\n\n\u2013 cash deposits and derivative financial instruments The credit risk relating to cash deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by the Group\u2019s treasury department. Relationships are maintained with a number of tier one institutional counterparties, ensuring compliance with Group policy relating to limits on the credit ratings of counterparties (between BBB+ and AAA).\n\nExcessive credit risk concentration is avoided through adhering to authorised limits for all counterparties.\n\nCounterparty\n\nCredit rating\n\nAuthorised limit \u00a3m\n\nGroup exposure 31 December 2019 \u00a3m\n\nCredit rating\n\nAuthorised limit \u00a3m\n\nCounterparty #1\n\nAA-\n\n125.0\n\n64.9\n\nAA-\n\n125.0\n\nCounterparty #2\n\nAAA\n\n150.0\n\n43.1\n\nA+\n\n100.0\n\nCounterparty #3\n\nA+\n\n100.0\n\n38.7\n\nA\n\n100.0\n\nCounterparty #4\n\nA\n\n100.0\n\n26.0\n\nAAA\n\n150.0\n\nCounterparty #5\n\nA\n\n75.0\n\n20.0\n\nAAA\n\n150.0\n\nSum of five largest exposures\n\n192.7\n\nSum of cash deposits and derivative financial instrument assets\n\n203.5\n\nFive largest exposures as a percentage of assets at risk\n\n95%\n\n144 144\n\nintu properties plc Annual report 2019 intu properties plc Annual report 2019\n\n2018\n\n32.1\n\n3.7\n\n35.8\n\nGroup exposure 31 December 2018 \u00a3m\n\n111.9\n\n44.1\n\n27.2\n\n22.3\n\n12.3\n\n217.8\n\n244.2\n\n"," Some of these limitations are: (a) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; (b) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (c) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; (d) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and (e) other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside our other GAAP-based financial\n\nperformance measures, net income and our other GAAP financial results.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nMarket risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates, as well as to a lesser extent, foreign exchange rates and inflation.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nWe are primarily exposed to changes in short-term interest rates with respect to our cost of borrowing under our 2017 Facility with SVB. We monitor our cost of borrowing under our various facilities, taking into account our funding requirements, and our expectation for short-term rates in the future. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, an increase or decrease in the interest rate on our 2017 Facility with SVB by 100 basis points would increase or decrease our annual interest expense by approximately $0.6 million and $0.7 million, respectively.\n\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\n\nBecause substantially all of our revenue and operating expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars, we do not believe that our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk is material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If a significant portion of our revenue and operating expenses becomes denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, we may not be able to effectively manage this risk, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by translation and by transactional foreign currency conversions.\n\nInflation Risk\n\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our\n\ncosts become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n","82\n\nFinancials \u2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nNote F1, cont\u2019d.\n\nImpairment of trade receivables and contract assets Trade receivables and contract assets are assessed for impairment under a unified model. The Company has determined that credit risk largely depends on both the risk in the country where the customer resides (e.g. ability to make cross border payments) as well as the payment pattern of the customer. There- fore, expected credit losses (ECLs) are calculated using a provision matrix that specifies a fixed rate depending both on the number of days past due and the country risk rating. The country risk ratings depends on the ratings used by all Export Credit Agencies within the OECD. The rates defined in the provision matrix are based on historical loss patterns for that grouping of customers. These rates are adjusted for current conditions as well as management expec- tations for changes to political risks and payment patterns in the future. The provision rates are higher on high risk countries compared to low risk countries and also higher on amounts that remain unpaid for longer periods of time. There were no significant changes to the model during the year.\n\nTrade receivables and contract assets together amounted to SEK 55,240 (64,350) million as of December 31, 2019. Provisions for expected credit losses on trade receivables and contract assets amounted to SEK 2,983 (4,123) million as of December 31, 2019. The allowance decreased in 2019 due to improvement in cash collection resulting in significant reduction of total past due invoices. The Company\u2019s write-offs have historically been low. During the year SEK 382 (890) million were written off due to the Company having no reasonable expectation of collection. Of these write-offs, SEK 0 (61) million are still subject to enforcement.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, the total amount payable to the Company under customer finance credits was SEK 5,924 (4,247) million. The carrying value of these assets was SEK 3,756 (2,883) million as of December 31, 2019, which represents the maximum exposure to credit risk on these assets. Customer finance is arranged for infrastructure projects in different geographic markets. As of December 31, 2019, there were a total of 80 (94) customer finance arrangements originated by or guaranteed by the Company. The five largest facilities represented 69% (62%) of the customer finance exposure in 2019. As of December 31, 2019, Middle East and Africa made up 49% (57%) of the oustanding exposure while South East Asia, Oceania and India made up 29% (15%). As of December 31, 2019, the Company also had unutilized customer finance commitments of SEK 25,854 (30,270) million.\n\nSecurity arrangements for customer finance facilities may include pledges of equipment, pledges of certain assets belonging to the borrower and pledges of shares in the operating company. If available, third-party risk coverage is, as a rule, arranged. \u201cThird-party risk coverage\u201d means that a financial payment guarantee covering the credit risk has been issued by a bank, an export credit agency or an insurance company. All such institutions have been rated at least investment grade. A credit risk transfer under a sub-participation arrange- ment with a bank can also be arranged. In this case the entire credit risk and the funding is taken care of by the bank for the part that they cover.\n\nInformation about financial guarantees related to customer finance is\n\nincluded in note D2, \u201cContingent liabilities.\u201d\n\nThe table below summarizes the Company\u2019s outstanding customer finance\n\nas of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\nMovements in allowances for impairment of trade receivables and contract assets\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nOutstanding customer finance credit risk exposure 1)\n\nOpening balance Decrease (\u2013)\/increase (+) in allowance Write-offs Translation difference Closing balance 1)\n\n1) Of which SEK 0 (15) million relates to contract assets.\n\n4,123 \u2013737 \u2013382 \u201321\n\n2,983\n\n4,575 420 \u2013890 18\n\n4,123\n\nFair value of customer finance credits Financial guarantees for third-parties Accrued interest\n\nMaximum exposure to credit risk Less third-party risk coverage\n\n2019\n\n3,756 24 14\n\n3,794 \u2013309\n\n2018\n\n2,883 42 21\n\n2,946 \u2013331\n\nThe Company\u2019s risk exposure, less third-party risk coverage\n\n3,485\n\n2,615\n\nThe distribution of trade receivables and contract assets closely follows the distribution of the Company\u2019s sales, see note B1, \u201cSegment information.\u201d The ten largest customers represented 49% (53%) of the total trade receivables and contract assets in 2019.\n\nAging analysis of gross values by risk category at December 31, 2019\n\nDays past due\n\n1\u201390\n\n91\u2013180\n\n181\u2013360\n\n>360\n\nCountry risk: Low Country risk: Medium Country risk: High\n\n1,347 891 583\n\n125 725 365\n\n127 600 217\n\n313 819 1,315\n\nTotal past due\n\n2,821\n\n1,215\n\n944\n\n2,447\n\nCustomer finance credit risk All major commitments to finance customers are made only after approval in accordance with the work procedure for the Board of Directors and according to the established credit approval process.\n\nTotal\n\n1,912 3,035 2,480\n\n7,427\n\n1) This table has been adjusted to show the maximum exposure to credit risk.\n\nFair value assessment of customer finance credits Customer finance risk exposures are held at fair value and are classified as Level 3 on the fair value hierarchy. The Credit Asset Management Team within Ericsson Credit AB, reporting to Head of Group Treasury and Customer Finance, has established a process with respect to measurement of fair values. The quarterly credit review uses an internal model to determine a commercial rating for each credit and for calculation of the fair value. The model is based on exter- nal credit rating, political\/country rating and bank pricing. Regular monitoring of customer behavior is also a part of the internal assessment. Revaluation of customer finance amounted to a net negative impact in the income statement of SEK 804 (1,073) million in 2019, of which SEK 804 (1,073) million is related to credits held as of December 31, 2019. This effect is presented within selling and administrative expenses and was mainly related to India and the Middle East, especially Iran and Iraq.\n\nPrior to the approval of new facilities reported as customer finance, an internal credit risk assessment is conducted in order to assess the credit rating of each transaction for political and commercial risk. The credit risk analysis is made by using an assessment tool, where the political risk rating is identical to the rating used by all Export Credit Agencies within the OECD. The commercial risk is assessed by analyzing a large number of parameters, which may affect the level of the future commercial credit risk exposure. The output from the assessment tool for the credit rating also includes an internal pricing of the risk. This is expressed as a risk margin per annum over funding cost."],"45":["April 26, 2019 $\n\nApril 28, 2017\n\n348 $ 11 26 (35 ) (54 ) 296 $\n\n218 $ 131 \u2014 (1 ) \u2014 348 $\n\n216 7 7 \u2014 (12 ) 218\n\n$\n\nAs of April 26, 2019, we had $296 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $252 million has been recorded in other long-term liabilities.

The decrease was further driven by the reduction in our provision for bad debts of $0.3 million in 2019, primarily due to improved efforts to collect on long outstanding and reserved receivables.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nThe carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value because their maturity is less than three months. Management believes the carrying amount of the equity and cost-method investments materially approximated fair value at March 31, 2019 based upon unobservable inputs. The fair values of these investments have been determined as Level 3 fair value measurements. The fair values of the Company's line of credit borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements and approximate carrying value excluding debt issuance costs. Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities, the fair value of the Company's line of credit borrowings at March 31, 2019 approximated the carrying value and are considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described in Note 6.

The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).\n\nThe levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:\n\nLevel 1 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the\n\nCompany has the ability to access.\n\nLevel 3 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\n\nThe asset\u2019s or liability\u2019s fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Inputs used in the valuation techniques to derive fair values are classified based on a three-level hierarchy, as follows:Level 1\u2014Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2\u2014Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets with insufficient volumeor infrequent transactions (less active markets), or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from orcorroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3\u2014Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities.The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company\u2019sinvestments are in money market funds, U.S. treasury bonds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, asset-backed securities and corporate debt securities, whichare classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, and were initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued at each reporting date utilizingmarket-observable data. The market-observable data included reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker\/dealer quotes, bids, offers, current spotrates and other industry and economic events.The fair value of these assets measured on a recurring basis was determined using the following inputs as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands): December 31, 2019 QuotedPrices inActiveMarkets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) Total FairValueAssets: Money market funds$\u2014 $2,010 $\u2014 $2,010U.S. treasury bonds\u2014 116,835 \u2014 116,835Commercial paper\u2014 44,300 \u2014 44,300Certificates of deposit\u2014 24,539 \u2014 24,539Asset-backed securities\u2014 73,499 \u2014 73,499Corporate debt securities\u2014 181,079 \u2014 181,079Total$\u2014 $442,262 $\u2014 $442,26282"],"50":["The following table shows the fair value of the DB pension plan assets for each category.\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nObservable markets data\n\nEquity securities\n\nCanadian\n\n1,017\n\n844\n\nForeign\n\n4,534\n\n3,770\n\nDebt securities\n\nCanadian\n\n13,216\n\n12,457\n\nForeign\n\n2,385\n\n2,004\n\nMoney market\n\n219\n\n327\n\nNon-observable markets inputs\n\nAlternative investments\n\nPrivate equities\n\n2,119\n\n1,804\n\nHedge funds\n\n1,001\n\n1,014\n\nReal estate\n\n948\n\n758\n\nOther\n\n91\n\n93\n\nTotal\n\n25,530\n\n23,071\n\nEquity securities included approximately $15 million of BCE common shares, or 0.06% of total plan assets, at December 31, 2019 and approximately $8 million of BCE common shares, or 0.03% of total plan assets, at December 31, 2018.\n\nThe fair value of the arrangement is included within other alternative investments.

If assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The Scheme holds a significant proportion of growth assets (equities, diversified growth fund and global absolute return fund) which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term. The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Scheme\u2019s long-term objectives.\n\nInflation risk\n\nA proportion of the Scheme\u2019s benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation leads to higher liabilities (although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation). The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.\n\nChange in bond yields\n\nA decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the Scheme\u2019s liabilities for accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Scheme\u2019s bond holdings.\n\nLife expectancy\n\nThe majority of the Scheme\u2019s obligations are to provide benefits for the lifetime of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.\n\nFunding requirements UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently. The ongoing funding valuation of the Scheme was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 30 April 2018 and showed a deficit of \u00a30.2m. The Company paid deficit contributions of \u00a370,000 for the year ending 31 March 2019 (2018: \u00a370,000), and has committed to contribute \u00a3140,000 per annum from 1 April 2019, which is expected to make good this shortfall by 31 March 2020. The next funding valuation is due no later than 30 April 2021, at which progress towards full-funding will be reviewed. The Company also pays expenses and PPF levies incurred by the Scheme.\n\nAssumptions used The last triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme was performed by an independent professional actuary at 30 April 2018 using the projected unit method of valuation. For the purposes of IAS 19 (revised) the actuarial valuation as at 30 April 2018 has been updated on an approximate basis to 31 March 2019. There have been no changes in the valuation methodology adopted for this year\u2019s disclosures compared to the prior year\u2019s disclosures.\n\nThe principal financial assumptions used to calculate the liabilities under IAS 19 (revised) are as follows:\n\n2019 %\n\n2018 %\n\nDiscount rate for scheme liabilities\n\n2.45\n\n2.60\n\nCPI inflation\n\n2.35\n\n2.25\n\nRPI inflation\n\n3.45\n\n3.35\n\nPension increases\n\nPre 1988 GMP\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nPost 1988 GMP\n\n2.10\n\n2.10\n\nPre 2004 non GMP\n\n5.00\n\n5.00\n\nPost 2004\n\n3.35\n\n3.25\n\nThe financial assumptions reflect the nature and term of the Scheme\u2019s liabilities.\n\nThe Group has assumed that mortality will be in line with nationally published mortality table S2NA with CMI 2018 projections related to members\u2019 years of birth with long-term rate of improvement of 1.5% per annum.
