The more significant provisions of the Tax Act as applicable to us are described below under “Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017”.\n\n(2)\n\nWorking capital and total assets decreased in fiscal 2019 primarily due to $36.1 billion of cash used for repurchases of our common stock during fiscal 2019 and also due to dividend payments, partially offset by the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our fiscal 2019 net income. Working capital and total assets sequentially increased in nearly all of the fiscal 2015 to 2018 periods presented primarily due to the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income generated during the periods presented and the issuances of long-term senior notes of $10.0 billion in fiscal 2018, and $14.0 billion in fiscal 2017. These working capital and total assets increases were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments in the fiscal 2015 to 2018 periods presented. In addition, our total assets were also affected in all periods presented by the repayments of notes payable and other borrowings as discussed further below.\n\n(3)\n\nOur notes payable and other borrowings, which represented the summation of our notes payable and other borrowings, current, and notes payable and other borrowings, non-current, as reported per our consolidated balance sheets as of the dates listed in the table above, decreased during fiscal 2019 primarily due to repayments of certain short-term borrowings and senior notes. Notes payable and other borrowings increased between fiscal 2015 and 2018 primarily due to the fiscal 2018 issuance of long-term senior notes of $10.0 billion and short-term borrowings of $2.5 billion, the fiscal 2017 issuance of long-term senior notes of $14.0 billion and short-term borrowings of $3.8 billion, and the fiscal 2016 short-term borrowings of $3.8 billion.

Credit Facility\n\nIn November 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the ‘‘2016 Credit Facility’’) with Silicon Valley Bank (‘‘SVB’’) as the lender. The 2016 Credit Facility provided a three-year, $25.0 million revolving credit facility, which included a maximum of $25.0 million letter of credit subfacility. Loan advances under the revolving facility were available of up to the full $25.0 million when the balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities minus outstanding revolving loans and letters of credit equaled or exceeded $50.0 million. If our net cash fell below $50.0 million, loan advances were determined based on a borrowing base equal to a specified percentage of the value of our eligible accounts receivable. Loans bore interest, at our option, at (i) the prime rate reported in The Wall Street Journal, minus 0.50% or (ii) a LIBOR rate determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility, plus 2.50%. Over the term of the 2016 Credit Facility, we paid customary closing fees, commitment fees and letter of credit fees for a facility of this size and type.\n\nIn September 2018, we entered into an amendment with SVB to reduce the unused revolving credit facility fee\n\non the 2016 Credit Facility from 0.4% to 0.3%.\n\nOur obligations under the 2016 Credit Facility were secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property. The 2016 Credit Facility required us to maintain compliance with customary affirmative and negative covenants, including compliance with an adjusted quick ratio of not less than 1.50:1.00, as determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility and restricted our ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions on our capital stock.\n\nOn November 1, 2019, the maturity date, we elected to allow the 2016 Credit Facility to expire without renewal. There were no outstanding loans or advances as of the maturity date. We currently have no plans for entering into a new borrowing facility.\n\n', ' . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

We believe our capital expenditures, excluding cash paid for acquisitions, for fiscal 2020 will be approximately $38.0 million to $42.0 million. The increase in projected capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 is the result of planned expansions of several of our distribution facilities.

The increase in non-cash charges of $9.4 million is primarily driven by changes in the fair value of earn-out liabilities of $4.4 million and higher depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in working capital of $26.8 million is a result of organic growth and acquisitions and includes $1.8 million of earn-out liability payments classified as operating activities.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $44.2 million in fiscal 2019 driven by $16.1 million in capital expenditures which included implementations of our Enterprise Resource Planning system and the buildouts of our headquarters in Ridgefield, CT and distribution center in Dallas, Texas. The Company used $28.1 million in cash to fund acquisitions, the most significant of which was Bassian.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $96.9 million for fiscal 2019 driven by $145.0 million of net proceeds received from the issuance of our Senior Notes, partially offset by $44.2 million to settle all borrowings outstanding on our ABL and $2.4 million of earn-out liability payments classified as financing activities.\n\n']",The legal reserve amount in 2019 was not provided in the information given.

What was the unfavorable claim reserve development in 2018?,"['At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our restricted investments consisted of long-term marketable securities that were also held in custodial accounts to fund the estimated future costs of collecting and recycling modules covered under our solar module collection and recycling program. As necessary, we fund any incremental amounts for our estimated collection and recycling obligations on an annual basis based on the estimated costs of collecting and recycling covered modules, estimated rates of return on our restricted investments, and an estimated solar module life of 25 years less amounts already funded in prior years. To ensure that amounts previously funded will be available in the future regardless of potential adverse changes in our financial condition (even in the case of our own insolvency), we have established a trust under which estimated funds are put into custodial accounts with an established and reputable bank, for which First Solar, Inc.; First Solar Malaysia Sdn. Bhd.; and First Solar Manufacturing GmbH are grantors. Trust funds may be disbursed for qualified module collection and recycling costs (including capital and facility related recycling costs), payments to customers for assuming collection and recycling obligations, and reimbursements of any overfunded amounts. Investments in the trust must meet certain investment quality criteria comparable to highly rated government or agency bonds.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold certain restricted investments for proceeds of $281.6 million and realized gains of $40.6 million on such sales as part of efforts to align the currencies of the investments with those of the corresponding collection and recycling liabilities and disburse $22.2 million of overfunded amounts. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold certain restricted investments for proceeds of $231.1 million and realized gains of $55.4 million on such sales as part of an effort to align the currencies of the investments with those corresponding collection and recycling liabilities and disburse $143.1 million of overfunded amounts. See Note 11. “Fair Value Measurements” to our consolidated financial statements for information about the fair value of our restricted investments.\n\nThe following tables summarize the unrealized gains and losses related to our restricted investments, by major security type, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\n\nAs of December 31, 2019\n\nForeign government obligations. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The unrealized losses were primarily due to increases in interest rates relative to rates at the time of purchase.

Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, consisting of net loss of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $26.2 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $16.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $10.0 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an outflow from the changes in accrued liabilities and other of $5.9 million and inventory of $5.6 million, partially offset by an inflow from changes in deferred revenue of $3.2 million.\n\nThe unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and other was driven by an increase in lease liabilities associated with the lease of the San Jose corporate office. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to build up of inventory and timing of shipments, partially offset by increased reserves. The favorable change in deferred revenues was primarily driven by increased bookings.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million, consisting of net loss of $27.6 million which includes payments for our internal investigation costs of $8.6 million, non-cash charges of $25.0 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.9 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $3.1 million, offset primarily by an outflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $6.1 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and inventory of $1.5 million.\n\nThe favorable change in deferred revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the sale of subscription and support. The favorable change in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, increased value added tax accrual due to timing of payments, and an increase in legal fees accrual. The unfavorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections. The unfavorable change in prepaid and other assets was mainly driven by the increase in deferred sales commissions due to higher deferred revenue and higher average commission rate. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to the timing of shipments.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $14.3 million, consisting of a net loss of $10.8 million, a cash decrease resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million and non-cash charges of $26.4 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $17.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance of $1.1 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $12.4 million and deferred revenue of $3.0 million, and an outflow from the change in accrued liabilities of $8.9 million, inventory of $4.7 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and accounts payable of $0.9 million.\n\n', 'PART II\n\nSummary of Cash Flows\n\nThe following table summarizes cash flow information for the periods presented:\n\nYear Ended\n\nJanuary 3, 2020\n\nDecember 28, 2018\n\nDecember 29, 2017\n\n(in millions)\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n\n$\n\n992 $\n\n768 $\n\n526\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n\n65\n\n(114)\n\n(71)\n\nNet cash used in financing activities\n\n(709)\n\n(707)\n\n(429)\n\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n\n$\n\n348 $\n\n(53) $\n\n26\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $224 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to more favorable timing of working capital changes including higher advance payments from customers, $59 million received for the Greek arbitration award and lower payments for integration and restructuring costs. These activities were partially offset by higher tax payments, the timing of interest payments and $60 million of proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps in the prior year.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $242 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to lower payments for taxes, integration and restructuring costs and proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps. This was partially offset by $24 million of cash paid related to the 2016 acquisition of Lockheed Martin\'s Information Systems & Global Solutions business (""IS&GS Business"").\n\nNet cash provided by investing activities increased $179 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to $178 million of proceeds received for the dispositions of our commercial cybersecurity and health staff augmentation businesses, $96 million of proceeds received for the sale of real estate properties and $81 million of cash paid in the prior year related to our 2016 acquisition. These activities were partially offset by $94 million of cash paid related to the acquisition of IMX, higher purchases of property, equipment and software and lower proceeds from promissory notes.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $43 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to $81 million of cash paid related to the 2016 acquisition of the IS&GS Business, partially offset by $40 million of proceeds from the settlement of a promissory note.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $2 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to the timing of debt payments and higher stock repurchases, partially offset by $23 million of cash paid related to a tax indemnification in the prior year and the timing of issuances of stock.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $278 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to $250 million of stock repurchases under the ASR program, $167 million of open market stock repurchases and $23 million of cash paid related to a tax indemnification liability. This was partially offset by $150 million of lower debt payments and $14 million of proceeds received from a real estate financing transaction.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe have outstanding performance guarantees and cross-indemnity agreements in connection with certain aspects of our business. We also have letters of credit outstanding principally related to performance guarantees on contracts and surety bonds outstanding principally related to performance and subcontractor payment bonds as described in ""Note 26—Commitments"" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These arrangements have not had, and management does not believe it is likely that they will in the future have, a material effect on our liquidity, capital resources, operations or financial condition.\n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc.']",The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was $224 million compared to 2018.,$224 million,1.0,0.9999999999666667,0.9999999999666667,0.5,0.9802838333247251

Contract modifications routinely occur to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. In most cases, contract modifications are for goods or services that are not distinct and, therefore, are accounted for as part of the existing contract. Transaction price estimates include additional consideration for submitted contract modifications or claims when we believe there is an enforceable right to the modification or claim, the amount can be reliably estimated, and its realization is reasonably assured. Amounts representing modifications accounted for as part of the existing contract are included in the transaction price and recognized as an adjustment to sales on a cumulative catch-up basis.\n\nIn addition, we are subject to audits of incurred costs related to many of our U.S. government contracts. These audits could produce different results than we have estimated for revenue recognized on our cost-based contracts with the U.S. government; however, our experience has been that our costs are acceptable to the government.\n\nContract Estimates\n\nUse of the cost-to-cost or other similar methods of revenue recognition requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the revenue and cost associated with the design, manufacture and delivery of our products and services. Revisions or adjustments to estimates of the transaction price, estimated costs at completion and estimated profit or loss of a performance obligation are often required as work progresses under a contract, as experience is gained, as facts and circumstances change and as new information is obtained, even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change. In determining the estimated costs at completion, we have to make assumptions regarding labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, estimated increases in wages and prices for materials, performance by our subcontractors, and the availability and timing of funding from our customer, among other variables. Revisions or adjustments to our estimated transaction price and estimated costs at completion may also be required if contract modifications occur. The revisions in contract estimates, if significant, can materially affect our results of operations and cash flows, and in some cases result in liabilities to complete contracts in a loss position. Based upon our history, we believe we have the ability to make reasonable estimates for these items. We have accounting policies and controls in place to address these, as well as other contractual and business arrangements to properly account for long-term contracts, and we continue to monitor and improve such policies, controls, and arrangements. For other information on such policies, controls and arrangements, see our discussion in Item 9A of this Form 10-K.\n\nProducts and services provided under long-term, fixed-price contracts represented approximately 97% of our sales for 2019. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if our underlying circumstances were to change. For example, if underlying assumptions were to change such that our estimated profit rate at completion for all fixed-price contracts accounted for under the cost-to-cost percentage-of-completion method was higher or lower by one percentage point, our 2019 operating income would have increased or decreased by approximately $6.5 million. When adjustments in estimated contract revenues or estimated costs at completion are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized by recording adjustments in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of the changes on current and prior periods using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period the loss is determined.\n\nThe aggregate impact of net changes in contract estimates are presented in the table below (amounts in thousands).\n\nOperating income (loss) Net income (loss) from continuing operations Diluted earnings per share\n\nYears Ended September 30, 2018\n\n2019\n\n$ (2,235) $ (6,986) $ (5,146) (0.19)\n\n(2,351) (0.08)\n\n2017 5,737 3,208 0.12\n\n', ' See Note 19 ""Pension and Postretirement Benefits"" to the consolidated financial statements and ""Critical Accounting Estimates - Employment Related Benefits"" contained in this report for further discussion of our pension obligations and factors that could affect estimates of this liability.\n\nAs part of our ongoing operations, we also enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments only upon the occurrence of a future event (e.g., guarantees of debt or lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable to perform). In accordance with U.S. GAAP, such commercial commitments are not recognized as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of May 26, 2019, we had other commercial commitments totaling $5.3 million, of which $3.7 million expire in less than one year and $1.6 million expire in one to three years.\n\nIn addition to the other commercial commitments, as of May 26, 2019, we had $56.4 million of standby letters of credit issued on our behalf. These standby letters of credit are primarily related to our self-insured workers compensation programs and are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nIn certain limited situations, we will guarantee an obligation of an unconsolidated entity. We guarantee certain leases resulting from the divestiture of the JM Swank business completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. As of May 26, 2019, the remaining terms of these arrangements did not exceed four years and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was $1.2 million. In addition, we guarantee a lease resulting from an exited facility. As of May 26, 2019, the remaining term of this arrangement did not exceed eight years and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was $19.1 million.\n\nWe also guarantee an obligation of the Lamb Weston business pursuant to a guarantee arrangement that existed prior to the Spinoff and remained in place following completion of the Spinoff until such guarantee obligation is substituted for guarantees issued by Lamb Weston. Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, dated as of November 8, 2016 (the ""Separation Agreement""), between us and Lamb Weston, this guarantee arrangement is deemed a liability of Lamb Weston that was transferred to Lamb Weston as part of the Spinoff. Accordingly, in the event that we are required to make any payments as a result of this guarantee arrangement, Lamb Weston is obligated to indemnify us for any such liability, reduced by any insurance proceeds received by us, in accordance with the terms of the indemnification provisions under the Separation Agreement.\n\nLamb Weston is a party to an agricultural sublease agreement with a third party for certain farmland through 2020 (subject, at Lamb Weston\'s option, to extension for two additional five-year periods).

Credit Facility\n\nIn November 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the ‘‘2016 Credit Facility’’) with Silicon Valley Bank (‘‘SVB’’) as the lender. The 2016 Credit Facility provided a three-year, $25.0 million revolving credit facility, which included a maximum of $25.0 million letter of credit subfacility. Loan advances under the revolving facility were available of up to the full $25.0 million when the balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities minus outstanding revolving loans and letters of credit equaled or exceeded $50.0 million. If our net cash fell below $50.0 million, loan advances were determined based on a borrowing base equal to a specified percentage of the value of our eligible accounts receivable. Loans bore interest, at our option, at (i) the prime rate reported in The Wall Street Journal, minus 0.50% or (ii) a LIBOR rate determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility, plus 2.50%. Over the term of the 2016 Credit Facility, we paid customary closing fees, commitment fees and letter of credit fees for a facility of this size and type.\n\nIn September 2018, we entered into an amendment with SVB to reduce the unused revolving credit facility fee\n\non the 2016 Credit Facility from 0.4% to 0.3%.\n\nOur obligations under the 2016 Credit Facility were secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property. The 2016 Credit Facility required us to maintain compliance with customary affirmative and negative covenants, including compliance with an adjusted quick ratio of not less than 1.50:1.00, as determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility and restricted our ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions on our capital stock.\n\nOn November 1, 2019, the maturity date, we elected to allow the 2016 Credit Facility to expire without renewal. There were no outstanding loans or advances as of the maturity date. We currently have no plans for entering into a new borrowing facility.\n\n', ' opening and closing balances of the Company’s accounts receivable and deferred revenue are as follows (in thousands): Balance at Beginning ofPeriod (1/1/19) Increase / (Decrease) Balance at End of PeriodYear Ended December 31, 2019 Accounts receivable$90,831 $7,117 $97,948Deferred revenue (current)$5,101 $(618) $4,483Deferred revenue (non-current)$3,707 $(263) $3,44477']","Amounts falling due within one year consist of the following financial items:

The SIP shareholders are entitled to dividends over the Vesting Period. There are no performance conditions applicable to the vesting of SIP shares.

Options exercised prior to the vesting date relate to those attributable to good leavers as defined by the scheme rules.\n\nPerformance Share Plan The Group operates a Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) for Executive Directors, the Operating Leadership Team and certain key employees. The extent to which awards vest will depend upon the Group’s performance over the three-year period following the award date. Both market based and non-market based performance conditions may be attached to the options, for which an appropriate adjustment is made when calculating the fair value of an option. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire. Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest, unless under exceptional circumstances.\n\nOn 17 August 2018, the Group awarded 452,695 nil cost options under the PSP scheme. For the 2018 awards, the Group’s performance is measured by reference to the growth in Operating profit (75% of the award) and growth in Revenue (25% of the award) over the three-year period April 2018 – March 2021. For previous awards, the Group’s performance had been measured by reference to the cumulative profit measure (Underlying operating profit for 2015 and 2016 awards, and Operating profit for 2017 awards) and total shareholder return relative to the FTSE 250 share index.\n\n', "" The amount of incremental PRSU awards thatcould ultimately vest if all performance criteria are achieved would be 1,196,337 shares assuming a maximum of 300% of the targeted shares.We granted 200,000 market-based RSUs during fiscal year 2019, at a weighted average grant date fair value of $17.65 per share, and a total fair value of $3.5million.

See Note 1, ""Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Accounting Standards Adopted"", of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\n(2) Net (loss) income per share were computed independently for each of the periods presented; therefore the sum of the net (loss) income\n\nper share amount for the quarters may not equal the total for the fiscal year.\n\n18.\n\nSubsequent Events\n\nIn February 2019 and March 2019, Autodesk repaid $75.0 million and $50.0 million, respectively for a total payment of\n\n$125.0 million on the $500.', 'clients on this journey. We brought additional new innovations to the market in 2019 including: the financial services public cloud, z15 and high-end storage and we have a leadership position in quantum computing. With these innovations, we built momentum for growth in 2020.\n\nAt the time of our fourth-quarter earnings report, analysts’ estimates of our revenue growth were approximately 3 percent for 2020, which we stated was reasonable. This includes about a 1 point impact from businesses divested in 2019, and January 17, 2020 expectations for currency translation. This also includes an expectation of an improving trend in GTS, predominantly in the second half of 2020. We also expect to expand GAAP and operating (non-GAAP) gross margins and pre-tax income will include impacts from significant structural actions in 2020, primarily in our GTS business as we shift toward a more asset-based model to create a more competitive, flexible structure.\n\nFor full-year 2020, we expect the GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 3 to 6 percent, including an estimate for potential discrete tax events (discretes). We expect the operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for 2020 to be approximately 7 to 9 percent, including an estimate of potential discretes. We expect a discrete tax benefit in the first quarter of 2020. Together with the expected structural actions described above, we anticipate that these two items will be approximately neutral to the first- quarter and full-year 2020 earnings per share. Discretes by their nature are difficult to estimate and the actual impacts will be recorded as the discrete events occur. The rates will change year to year based on discrete tax events, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors including the geographic mix of income before taxes, state and local taxes and the effects of various global income tax strategies. The GAAP effective tax rate could also be affected by adjustments to the previously recorded charges for U.S. tax reform attributable to any changes in law, new regulations and guidance, audit adjustments, among others.\n\nAt constant currency, we expect accelerated growth of about 0.5 points from the fourth-quarter 2019 revenue growth rates to first-quarter 2020. At January 17, 2020 spot rates, we expect currency to be a headwind to first-quarter revenue growth of about 1.0 to 1.5 points, as compared to a headwind of 0.6 points in the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\nConsistent with the acquisition of a highly profitable software business, non-cash purchase accounting adjustments resulted in the Red Hat acquisition being dilutive to full-year 2019 earnings per share. In an acquisition, U.S. GAAP requires a company to record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair value. This includes the acquired deferred revenue balance. This resulted in a non-cash adjustment of $2.2 billion to the acquired deferred revenue balance and resulted in a reduction to reported revenue post-closing. The level of adjustment reflects the high margin profile of Red Hat’s subscription-based business. While there will be continued impact in 2020 from the deferred revenue adjustment from the Red Hat purchase accounting, it will largely be in the first half and lessen throughout the year.\n\nOverall, we expect GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations for 2020 to be at least $10.57. Excluding acquisition-related charges of $1.70 per share, non-operating retirement-related items of $1.02 per share and tax reform enactment impacts of $0.06 per share, operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share is expected to be at least $13.35. For the first quarter of 2020, we expect GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations to be 12 to 13 percent of the full-year expectation and operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share to be approximately 14 to 15 percent of the respective full-year expectation. This reflects typical seasonality of IBM’s operations, and the impact of the Red Hat deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustment.\n\nWe expect free cash flow to be approximately $12.5 billion in 2020. This includes contribution from Red Hat combined with incremental software and services synergy profits and net of incremental interest to finance the transaction and other acquisition-related charges. Free cash flow expectations reflect expected operational profit performance, partially offset by headwinds in capital expenditures and cash tax.\n\nThe Red Hat acquisition was funded through a combination of cash and debt, with the incremental debt issued in the first half of 2019. We will continue with a disciplined financial policy and are committed to maintaining strong investment-grade credit ratings. Since the end of the second quarter of 2019, we reduced our debt balance by $10.1 billion. We are continuing to target a leverage profile consistent with a mid to high single A credit rating within a couple years, while maintaining our solid and growing dividend. We suspended our share repurchase program at the close of the acquisition to direct our free cash flow towards reducing debt levels. The combination of these actions provides us with the flexibility to invest in the business going forward.\n\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2019 and continuing throughout the year, IBM’s Global Financing business wound down the portion of its commercial financing operations which provides short-term working capital solutions for OEM information technology suppliers, distributors and resellers. This was consistent with our capital allocation strategy and high-value focus. IBM Global Financing will continue to provide differentiated end-to-end financing solutions, including commercial financing in support of IBM partner relationships.\n\nWe expect 2020 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $2.7 billion, an increase of approximately $600 million compared to 2019. This estimate reflects current pension plan assumptions at December 31, 2019. Within total retirement-related plan cost, operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion, approximately flat versus 2019. Non-operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.2 billion, an increase of approximately $600 million compared to 2019, primarily driven by lower income from expected return on assets. Contributions for all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.3 billion in 2020, an increase of approximately $100 million compared to 2019.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources The company has consistently generated strong cash flow from operations, providing a source of funds ranging between $14.8 billion and $16.7 billion per year over the past three years. The company provides for additional liquidity through several sources: maintaining an adequate cash balance, access to\n\n57\n\n58\n\nglobal funding sources, committed global credit facilities and other committed and uncommitted lines of credit worldwide.

Additionally, the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects a $92 million unfavorable impact due to finalizing the impacts of tax reform. Partially offsetting these amounts is a $142 million benefit generated by a loss carryback to 2016. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects the benefit of approximately $1.1 billion from the re-measurement of deferred taxes as noted above, a $27 million tax expense related to the sale of our colocation business and $32 million tax impact of non-deductible transaction costs related to the Level 3 acquisition.\n\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets\n\nand deferred tax liabilities were as follows:\n\nAs of December 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\nDeferred tax assets\n\nPost-retirement and pension benefit costs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $\n\n1,169\n\n1,111\n\nNet operating loss carryforwards . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n3,167\n\n3,445\n\nOther employee benefits . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n134\n\n162\n\nOther . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n577\n\n553\n\nGross deferred tax assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n5,047\n\n5,271\n\nLess valuation allowance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n(1,319)\n\n(1,331)\n\nNet deferred tax assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n3,728\n\n3,940\n\nDeferred tax liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, primarily due to depreciation differences . . . . . . .\n\n(3,489)\n\n(3,011)\n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n(3,019)\n\n(3,303)\n\nOther . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n—\n\n', ' . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $0.7 million, $0.9 million and $8.9 million for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Stock Options with Time-based Vesting CriteriaIn November 2017, we granted 10,924 incentive stock options and 69,076 non-qualified stock options with a total grant date fair value of $17.55 per share,or $1.4 million. These stock options were valued using a Black-Scholes model, using a volatility rate of 45.7%, a risk-free rate of 2.21%, a strike priceof $36.61 and an expected term of 6.5 years. Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period which approximated4.5 years for these awards. These awards were included in the cancellation during the fiscal first quarter of 2019 as discussed in the section below.Stock Options with Market-based Vesting CriteriaWe grant NQs that are subject to vesting only upon the market price of our underlying public stock closing above a certain price target within seven years ofthe date of grant. Share-based compensation expense is recognized regardless of the number of awards that are earned based on the market condition and isrecognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated service period of approximately three years. If the required service period is not met for these options, thenthe share-based compensation expense would be reversed. In the event that our common stock achieves the target price per share based on a 30-day trailingaverage prior to the end of the estimated service period, any remaining unamortized compensation cost will be recognized.Stock options with market-based vesting criteria granted for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 were 585,000, 325,000 and 320,000, respectively, atweighted average grant date fair values of $7.47, $15.52 and $13.18 per share, or total grant date fair value $2.4 million, $5.0 million and $4.3 million,respectively.78\n\nThese NQs with market-based vesting criteria were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The weighted average Monte Carlo input assumptionsused for calculating the fair value of these market-based stock options are as follows: Fiscal Years 2019 2018 2017Risk-free interest rate2.8% 2.3% 1.9%Expected term (years)3.9 3.4 7.0Expected volatility51.9% 45.8% 32.3%Target price$53.87 $98.99 $67.39During our fiscal first quarter of 2019, we canceled 1,122,500 performance-based stock options with a concurrent grant of 748,328 PRSUs for 13 employees,which was accounted for as a modification. The incremental compensation cost resulting from the modification was $8.2 million, and was being recognized asshare-based compensation expense over the requisite service period of three years for the new PRSU awards. As a result of subsequent actions that resulted inforfeitures, the remaining compensation expense associated with this modification as of September 27, 2019 is $2.8 million.Restricted Stock Awards and UnitsA summary of restricted stock awards and units activity for fiscal year 2019 is as follows (in thousands): Number of Shares Weighted-AverageGrant Date FairValue AggregateIntrinsic ValueIssued and unvested - September 28, 20181,872 $34.15 $38,452Granted2,977 18.18 Vested(673) 34.87 Forfeited, canceled or expired(1,563) 24.06 Issued and unvested - September 27, 20192,613 21.81 $56,649As of September 27, 2019, the aggregate intrinsic value of expected to vest restricted stock units including time-based, performance-based, and market-basedunits was $56.3 million for fiscal year 2019.

RSUs granted generally vest over a period of four years.In addition to RSUs, we also issue PRSUs with specific performance vesting criteria. These PRSUs have both a service and performance-based vestingcondition and awards are divided into three equal tranches and vest based on achieving certain adjusted earnings per share growth metrics. The service conditionrequires participants to be employed on May 15th of the following year once the performance condition has been met. Depending on the actual performanceachieved, a participant may earn between 0% to 300% of the targeted shares for each tranche, which is determined based on a straight-line interpolation appliedfor the achievement between the specified performance ranges.

The decrease is attributable to a decrease of $203.7 million in net cash used in payments for the construction costs of newbuildings and other fixed assets, a net increase of $45.5 million in cash from short-term investments in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period of 2018 and an increase of $0.8 million in cash from interest income.\n\nNet Cash Provided By Financing Activities\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased by $318.0 million, from $368.1 million during\n\nthe year ended December 31, 2018 to $50.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.

The increase was attributable to an increase in total revenues (revenues and net pool allocation) of $103.7 million, partially offset by a decrease of $23.5 million caused by movements in working capital accounts, an increase of $15.3 million in cash paid for interest including the interest paid for finance leases and a net decrease of $4.8 million from the remaining movements.\n\nNet Cash Used In Investing Activities\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $618.4 million, from $74.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $693.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.

The timing of invoicing to our customers is a negotiated term and thus varies among our subscription contracts. Payment terms are generally billed either monthly or on an annual basis. At any point in the contract term, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice, which constitute backlog. Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, we do not recognize them as revenues, unearned revenues or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements. Given the variability in our contract length, we believe that backlog is not a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.\n\nDeferred Revenue\n\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of invoiced fees for our subscriptions, which we recognize as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. Customers with annual or multi-year contracts may opt for annual invoicing. For these customers, we generally invoice only one annual subscription period in advance. Therefore, our deferred revenue balance does not capture the full contract value of such multi-year contracts. Accordingly, we believe that deferred revenue is not a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize deferred revenue as a key management metric internally.\n\nContractual Obligations\n\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\n\nPayments due by period\n\nUp to 1 year\n\n1 to 3 years\n\n3 to 5 years\n\nMore than 5 years\n\nOperating lease obligations\n\n16,164\n\n19,812\n\n6,551\n\n5,883\n\nFinancing obligations\n\n2,956\n\n5,912\n\n—\n\n—\n\nLong-term debt\n\n—\n\n—\n\n460,000\n\n—\n\nPurchase obligations\n\n55,755\n\n16,220\n\n7,595\n\n17,649\n\nTotal\n\n74,875\n\n41,944\n\n474,146\n\n23,532\n\nPurchase obligations represent an estimate of open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the normal course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of December 31, 2019.

Stock-based compensation cost, and the year-to-year change, was reflected in the following categories: Cost: $100 million, up $18 million; SG&A expense: $453 million, up $91 million; and RD&E expense: $126 million, up $60 million.\n\nintangible assets\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n50.0%\n\nAcquisition-related\n\ncharges\n\nNon-operating retirement- related costs/(income)\n\nOperating (non-GAAP) other (income) and expense\n\n154\n\n(615)\n\n$(1,431)\n\n0\n\n(1,572)\n\n$ (422)\n\nNM\n\n(60.9)%\n\n239.4%\n\nRetirement-Related Plans The following table provides the total pre-tax cost for all retirement-related plans.

With the enactment of Tax Reform, we believe thatour offshore cash can be accessed in a more tax efficient manner than before Tax Reform. Currently, we believe that our cash balance, together with cash availableunder our Credit Facility, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs and potential share repurchases, if any, for the next twelve months and for the foreseeablefuture.Our future cash flows from operating activities will be reduced by $65.1 million due to cash payments for U.S. federal taxes on the deemed repatriation ofundistributed foreign earnings that are payable over an eight year period that began in fiscal 2019 with the first payment.

For Combustion of fuel and operation of facilities:
- Total energy consumption in 2019: 19,144.17 MWh
- Total energy consumption in 2018: 12,852.04 MWh

For Electricity, heat, steam, and cooling purchased for own use:
- Total energy consumption in 2019: 185,948.09 MWh
- Total energy consumption in 2018: 154,636.44 MWh

Now, we calculate the total energy consumption for each year:
2019 total energy consumption: 19,144.17 + 185,948.09 = 205,092.26 MWh
2018 total energy consumption: 12,852.04 + 154,636.44 = 167,488.48 MWh

Next, we find the percentage change in total energy consumption:
Percentage Change = ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100

For Combustion of fuel and operation of facilities:
((19,144.17 - 12,852.04) / 12,852.04) * 100 ≈ 49.1%

For Electricity, heat, steam, and cooling purchased for own use:
((185,948.09 - 154,636.44) / 154,636.44) * 100 ≈ 20.3%

Therefore, the percentage change in the total amount of emissions from Combustion of fuel and operation of facilities is approximately 49.1% and for Electricity, heat, steam, and cooling purchased for own use is approximately 20.3%.",6.14 per cent,1.0,0.99999999995,0.99999999995,0.3333333333333333,0.9985345696369053
What is the value of the goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2019?,"['General and administrative expenses in 2019 decreased by $2.7 million, or 20%, as compared to 2018. Compensation and benefits expense decreased by\n\n$2.1 million in 2019, primarily due to reductions in headcount and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense, driven by employee turnover and the decline in our stock price. The decrease was further driven by the reduction in our provision for bad debts of $0.3 million in 2019, primarily due to improved efforts to collect on long outstanding and reserved receivables. We also did not incur restructuring costs in 2019, as compared to 2018 when $0.2 million was incurred as part of the 2018 Restructuring Plan (refer to Note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements).\n\nImpairment of Goodwill\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\nChange\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n$\n\nImpairment of goodwill\n\n$\n\n1,910\n\n$\n\n(dollars in thousands) $\n\n14,740\n\n(12,830)\n\nPercent of revenues, net\n\n4 %\n\n26 %\n\nWe recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, reducing the goodwill balance to zero at that time.

The primary driver for this change was the current foreign income tax provision, which was $0.2 million in 2019, as compared to $0.9 million in 2018. In 2019, there was a net benefit of $0.3 million from the reserve for uncertain foreign tax positions primarily due to the close of the statute of limitations on several such positions during the year. This compared to 2018, when there was a $0.4 million net expense related to the reserve for uncertain foreign tax positions. The remaining decrease in the current foreign income tax provision was primarily due to reduced profits earned by our wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries as compared to 2018.\n\n37\n\n%\n\n%\n\n%\n\n%\n\n(87) %\n\n100 %\n\n41 %\n\n', 'The following table summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the fiscal years ended January 31,\n\n2019 and 2018:\n\nJanuary 31, 2019\n\nJanuary 31, 2018\n\nGoodwill, beginning of the year\n\n$\n\n1,769.4\n\n$\n\n1,710.3\n\nLess: accumulated impairment losses, beginning of the year\n\n(149.2)\n\n(149.2)\n\nAdditions arising from acquisitions during the year\n\n866.9\n\n—\n\nEffect of foreign currency translation, measurement period adjustments, and other (1)\n\n(36.3)\n\n59.1\n\nGoodwill, end of the year\n\n$\n\n2,450.8\n\n$\n\n1,620.2\n\n_______________ (1) Purchase accounting adjustments reflect revisions made to the Company’s preliminary determination of estimated fair value of assets\n\nand liabilities assumed during fiscal 2019 and 2018.\n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nAt least annually or more frequently as circumstances dictate, Autodesk reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever impairment indicators exist. Autodesk continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate the carrying amounts of its long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, Autodesk assesses recoverability of these assets. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the carrying amounts of the assets to the future undiscounted cash flow the assets are expected to generate. If the long-lived assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. Autodesk did not recognize any material impairments of long-lived assets during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\n\nIn addition to the recoverability assessments, Autodesk routinely reviews the remaining estimated useful lives of its long-\n\nlived assets. Any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made, as well as in subsequent quarters.\n\nDeferred Tax Assets\n\nDeferred tax assets arise primarily from tax credits, net operating losses, and timing differences for reserves, accrued liabilities, stock options, deferred revenue, purchased technologies, and capitalized intangibles, partially offset by U.S. deferred tax liabilities on acquired intangibles, and valuation allowances against U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets. Autodesk performed a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets and believes it will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize the net deferred tax assets. They are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce gross deferred tax assets to the amount that is ""more likely than not"" to be realized.\n\nStock-based Compensation Expense\n\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, as\n\nfollows:\n\nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nCost of subscription and maintenance revenue\n\n$\n\n13.2\n\n$\n\n11.9\n\n$\n\n8.6\n\nCost of other revenue\n\n4.3\n\n4.0\n\n5.5\n\nMarketing and sales\n\n109.4\n\n107.3\n\n94.1\n\nResearch and development\n\n82.6\n\n82.9\n\n81.3\n\nGeneral and administrative\n\n40.0\n\n55.3\n\n32.3\n\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock awards and Employee Qualified\n\nStock Purchase Plan (""ESPP"") purchases\n\n249.5\n\n261.4\n\n221.8\n\nTax benefit\n\n(2.6)\n\n(2.6)\n\n(2.6)\n\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock awards and ESPP purchases,\n\nnet\n\n$\n\n246.9\n\n$\n\n258.8\n\n$\n\n219.2\n\n2019 Form 10-K 71\n\nt r o p e R\n\nl a u n n A 9 1 0 2\n\n2 0 1 9 A n n u a l\n\nR e p o r t\n\nAutodesk determines the grant date fair value of its share-based payment awards using a Black-Scholes Merton (""BSM"") option pricing model or the quoted stock price on the date of grant, unless the awards are subject to market conditions, in which case Autodesk uses a binomial-lattice model (e.g., Monte Carlo simulation model).

The expected volatility for performance stock units subject to market conditions includes the expected volatility of Autodesk\'s peer companies within the S&P Computer Software Select Index or S&P North American Technology Software Index with a market capitalization over $2.00 billion, depending on the award type.\n\nAutodesk estimates the expected life of stock-based awards using both exercise behavior and post-vesting termination\n\nbehavior as well as consideration of outstanding options. The range of expected lives of ESPP awards are based upon the four, six-month exercise periods within a 24-month offering period.\n\nAutodesk did not pay cash dividends in fiscal 2019, 2018, or 2017 and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in\n\nthe foreseeable future. Consequently, an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the BSM option pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation model.\n\nThe risk-free interest rate used in the BSM option pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation model for stock-based\n\nawards is the historical yield on U.S. Treasury securities with equivalent remaining lives.\n\nAutodesk recognizes expense only for the stock-based awards that ultimately vest.

If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\nGoodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the cash-generating unit to which it relates is greater than the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use.\n\nFor the year-ended 31 March 2019, the Directors have reviewed the value of goodwill based on internal value in use calculations. The key assumptions for these calculations are discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to billings and direct costs during the period.\n\nThe Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the Directors’ most recent financial forecasts for the following five years. The growth rates for the five-year period are based on Directors’ expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the cash-generating unit, planned growth in market share, industry forecasts, growth in the market and specific regional considerations and are in line with past experience. Discount rates have been estimated based on rates that reflect current market assessments of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital.\n\nThe key assumptions used in the assessments in the year-ended 31 March 2019 are as follows:\n\nAmericas\n\nEMEA\n\nAPJ\n\nLong-term regional growth rate beyond five years\n\n2.5%\n\n1.5%\n\n2.0%\n\nDiscount rate\n\n9.0%\n\n9.0%\n\n10.0%\n\nThe key assumptions used in the assessments in the year-ended 31 March 2018 were as follows:\n\nAmericas\n\nEMEA\n\nAPJ\n\nLong-term regional growth rate beyond five years\n\n2.5%\n\n1.5%\n\n2.0%\n\nDiscount rate\n\n9.5%\n\n9.5%\n\n10.5%\n\nAs at 31 March 2019, there were no indicators of impairment that suggested the carrying amounts of the Group’s long-lived assets are not recoverable. In order to assess the sensitivity in the assumptions made, the Directors have flexed the discount rate upward by thirty per cent of the above rates, and noted that this still did not give any indication of impairment.\n\n153']",The value of the goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2019 was $1.9 million.,$1.9 million,1.0,0.8333333332916666,0.8333333332916666,,0.9938221425106213

The computation of EBITDA refers to financial income and expenses which the Company deems to be equivalent to “interest” for purposes of presenting EBITDA. Financial expenses consist of interest on borrowings, losses on foreign exchange transactions and bank charges. Financial income consists of interest income and gains on foreign exchange transactions.\n\nEBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by Management and external users of financial statements, such as lenders, to assess TORM's operating performance as well as compliance with the financial covenants and restrictions contained in the Company's financing agreements. TORM believes that EBITDA assists Management and investors by increasing comparability of the Company's performance from period to period. This increased comparability is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects of interest, depreciation, impairment, amortization and taxes. These are items that could be affected by various changing financing methods and capital structure and which may significantly affect profit/(loss) between periods. Including EBITDA as a measure benefits investors in selecting between investment alternatives.\n\nEBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect profit/(loss), and these measures may vary among other companies and not be directly comparable.

In addition, Film and Electrolytic net sales increased by $4.3 million, and MSA net sales increased by $13.8 million.\n\nThe increase in Solid Capacitors net sales was primarily driven by a $111.8 million increase in distributor sales across the Americas, APAC, and EMEA regions. The $111.8 million increase consisted of a $72.8 million increase in Ceramic product line sales and a $39.0 million increase in Tantalum product line sales. Also contributing to the increase in net sales was a $30.6 million increase in OEM sales across the APAC, EMEA, and JPKO regions, and a $28.0 million increase in EMS sales across all regions. These increases in net sales were partially offset by a $3.2 million decrease in distributor sales in the JPKO region and a $2.7 million decrease in OEM sales in the Americas region. In addition, Solid Capacitors net sales was unfavorably impacted by $0.5 million from foreign currency exchange due to the change in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe increase in Film and Electrolytic net sales was primarily driven by a $10.5 million increase in distributor sales\n\nacross the Americas and EMEA regions.

How much did net financing costs increase by between 2018 and 2019?,"['Table of Contents\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $296.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This was driven by our $135.6 million purchase of long-term investments, $89.1 million cash paid to acquire intellectual property, $44.3 million in capital expenditures including personnel-\n\nrelated costs associated with development of internal-use software, and $27.9 million net cash paid for our acquisition of Connect First, Inc.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $213.3 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to our $135.6 million purchase of long-term investments, an increase of $70.6 million in cash paid for the\n\nacquisition of intangible assets, and higher capital expenditures during 2019.\n\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\n\nOur primary financing activities have consisted of raising proceeds through the issuance of stock under our stock plans and issuance of our Notes.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was approximately $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily resulting from $15.2 million in proceeds from the issuance of shares in connection with our stock plans, net of taxes paid. This was partially offset by payments\n\nof $5.2 million of contingent consideration associated with acquisitions, and repayment of our financing obligation of $0.9 million.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, decreased by $388.2 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to proceeds from our Notes issued in 2018.\n\nBacklog\n\nWe have generally signed new customers to contracts that vary in length, from month-to-month to multi-year terms for our subscriptions. The timing of invoicing to our customers is a negotiated term and thus varies among our subscription contracts. Payment terms are generally billed either monthly or on an annual basis. At any point in the contract term, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice, which constitute backlog. Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, we do not recognize them as revenues, unearned revenues or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements. Given the variability in our contract length, we believe that backlog is not a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.\n\nDeferred Revenue\n\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of invoiced fees for our subscriptions, which we recognize as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. Customers with annual or multi-year contracts may opt for annual invoicing. For these customers, we generally invoice only one annual subscription period in advance. Therefore, our deferred revenue balance does not capture the full contract value of such multi-year contracts. Accordingly, we believe that deferred revenue is not a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize deferred revenue as a key management metric internally.\n\nContractual Obligations\n\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\n\nPayments due by period\n\nUp to 1 year\n\n1 to 3 years\n\n3 to 5 years\n\nMore than 5 years\n\nOperating lease obligations\n\n16,164\n\n19,812\n\n6,551\n\n5,883\n\nFinancing obligations\n\n2,956\n\n5,912\n\n—\n\n—\n\nLong-term debt\n\n—\n\n—\n\n460,000\n\n—\n\nPurchase obligations\n\n55,755\n\n16,220\n\n7,595\n\n17,649\n\nTotal\n\n74,875\n\n41,944\n\n474,146\n\n23,532\n\nPurchase obligations represent an estimate of open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the normal course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of December 31, 2019.

The increase was primarily due to more favorable timing of working capital changes including higher advance payments from customers, $59 million received for the Greek arbitration award and lower payments for integration and restructuring costs. These activities were partially offset by higher tax payments, the timing of interest payments and $60 million of proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps in the prior year.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $242 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to lower payments for taxes, integration and restructuring costs and proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps. This was partially offset by $24 million of cash paid related to the 2016 acquisition of Lockheed Martin\'s Information Systems & Global Solutions business (""IS&GS Business"").\n\nNet cash provided by investing activities increased $179 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to $178 million of proceeds received for the dispositions of our commercial cybersecurity and health staff augmentation businesses, $96 million of proceeds received for the sale of real estate properties and $81 million of cash paid in the prior year related to our 2016 acquisition. These activities were partially offset by $94 million of cash paid related to the acquisition of IMX, higher purchases of property, equipment and software and lower proceeds from promissory notes.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $43 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to $81 million of cash paid related to the 2016 acquisition of the IS&GS Business, partially offset by $40 million of proceeds from the settlement of a promissory note.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $2 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to the timing of debt payments and higher stock repurchases, partially offset by $23 million of cash paid related to a tax indemnification in the prior year and the timing of issuances of stock.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $278 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to $250 million of stock repurchases under the ASR program, $167 million of open market stock repurchases and $23 million of cash paid related to a tax indemnification liability. This was partially offset by $150 million of lower debt payments and $14 million of proceeds received from a real estate financing transaction.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe have outstanding performance guarantees and cross-indemnity agreements in connection with certain aspects of our business. We also have letters of credit outstanding principally related to performance guarantees on contracts and surety bonds outstanding principally related to performance and subcontractor payment bonds as described in ""Note 26—Commitments"" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Autodesk continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate the carrying amounts of its long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, Autodesk assesses recoverability of these assets. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the carrying amounts of the assets to the future undiscounted cash flow the assets are expected to generate. If the long-lived assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. Autodesk did not recognize any material impairments of long-lived assets during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\n\nIn addition to the recoverability assessments, Autodesk routinely reviews the remaining estimated useful lives of its long-\n\nlived assets. Any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made, as well as in subsequent quarters.\n\nDeferred Tax Assets\n\nDeferred tax assets arise primarily from tax credits, net operating losses, and timing differences for reserves, accrued liabilities, stock options, deferred revenue, purchased technologies, and capitalized intangibles, partially offset by U.S. deferred tax liabilities on acquired intangibles, and valuation allowances against U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets. Autodesk performed a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets and believes it will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize the net deferred tax assets. They are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce gross deferred tax assets to the amount that is ""more likely than not"" to be realized.\n\nStock-based Compensation Expense\n\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, as\n\nfollows:\n\nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nCost of subscription and maintenance revenue\n\n$\n\n13.2\n\n$\n\n11.9\n\n$\n\n8.6\n\nCost of other revenue\n\n4.3\n\n4.0\n\n5.5\n\nMarketing and sales\n\n109.4\n\n107.3\n\n94.1\n\nResearch and development\n\n82.6\n\n82.9\n\n81.3\n\nGeneral and administrative\n\n40.0\n\n55.3\n\n32.3\n\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock awards and Employee Qualified\n\nStock Purchase Plan (""ESPP"") purchases\n\n249.5\n\n261.4\n\n221.8\n\nTax benefit\n\n(2.6)\n\n(2.6)\n\n(2.6)\n\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock awards and ESPP purchases,\n\nnet\n\n$\n\n246.9\n\n$\n\n258.8\n\n$\n\n219.2\n\n2019 Form 10-K 71\n\nt r o p e R\n\nl a u n n A 9 1 0 2\n\n2 0 1 9 A n n u a l\n\nR e p o r t\n\nAutodesk determines the grant date fair value of its share-based payment awards using a Black-Scholes Merton (""BSM"") option pricing model or the quoted stock price on the date of grant, unless the awards are subject to market conditions, in which case Autodesk uses a binomial-lattice model (e.g., Monte Carlo simulation model).

The expected volatility for performance stock units subject to market conditions includes the expected volatility of Autodesk\'s peer companies within the S&P Computer Software Select Index or S&P North American Technology Software Index with a market capitalization over $2.00 billion, depending on the award type.\n\nAutodesk estimates the expected life of stock-based awards using both exercise behavior and post-vesting termination\n\nbehavior as well as consideration of outstanding options. The range of expected lives of ESPP awards are based upon the four, six-month exercise periods within a 24-month offering period.\n\nAutodesk did not pay cash dividends in fiscal 2019, 2018, or 2017 and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in\n\nthe foreseeable future. Consequently, an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the BSM option pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation model.\n\nThe risk-free interest rate used in the BSM option pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation model for stock-based\n\nawards is the historical yield on U.S. Treasury securities with equivalent remaining lives.\n\nAutodesk recognizes expense only for the stock-based awards that ultimately vest.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nMarket risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates, as well as to a lesser extent, foreign exchange rates and inflation.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nWe are primarily exposed to changes in short-term interest rates with respect to our cost of borrowing under our 2017 Facility with SVB. We monitor our cost of borrowing under our various facilities, taking into account our funding requirements, and our expectation for short-term rates in the future. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, an increase or decrease in the interest rate on our 2017 Facility with SVB by 100 basis points would increase or decrease our annual interest expense by approximately $0.6 million and $0.7 million, respectively.\n\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\n\nBecause substantially all of our revenue and operating expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars, we do not believe that our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk is material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If a significant portion of our revenue and operating expenses becomes denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, we may not be able to effectively manage this risk, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by translation and by transactional foreign currency conversions.\n\nInflation Risk\n\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our\n\ncosts become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n']","The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is established to reduce gross deferred tax assets to the amount that is ""more likely than not"" to be realized.

Volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was flat in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior-year period. This result reflected merchandising changes and price elasticity-related declines in certain brands, as well as isolated production challenges, partially offset by the continued benefit from momentum and innovation successes in the snacks businesses. Price/ mix was flat compared to the prior year as unfavorable mix, coupled with increases in brand building investments with retailers were offset by the impact of higher pricing. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC, which was completed in October 2017, contributed $41.3 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 results included $115.9 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $156.4 million of net sales related to this divested business.\n\nRefrigerated & Frozen net sales for fiscal 2019 were $2.80 billion, an increase of $51.0 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 1% increase in volume compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales volumes was a result of innovation across multiple brands, which was partially offset by the effects of reduced merchandising spend and the impact of a recall during the fourth quarter. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2018, as continued delivery of top-line accretive innovation in several brands was partially offset by brand building investments with retailers. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business, which was completed in February 2018, contributed $25.7 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition.\n\nInternational net sales for fiscal 2019 were $793.4 million, a decrease of $50.1 million, or 6%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 2% increase in volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, a 4% decrease due to foreign exchange rates, and a 2% increase in price/mix, in each case compared to fiscal 2018. The volume and price/ mix increases for fiscal 2019 were driven by growth in the Canadian snacks and frozen businesses. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $3.7 million to International net sales for fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 included $4.1 million of net sales related to our Del Monte® processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada, which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $48.9 million of net sales related to this divested business. In addition, fiscal 2019 and 2018 results included $17.1 million and $24.5 million, respectively, related to our divested Wesson® oil business.\n\nFoodservice net sales for fiscal 2019 were $934.2 million, a decrease of $120.6 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 14% decrease in volume, excluding divestitures. The decline in volume reflected the continued execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy and the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Price/mix increased 5% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in price/mix for fiscal 2019 reflected favorable product and customer mix, the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing, and the execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy. Fiscal 2019 included $34.2 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $53.4 million of net sales related to this divested business. Net sales declined by approximately 7% in fiscal 2019 due to the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility.\n\nPinnacle Foods net sales for fiscal 2019 (reflecting 213 days of Conagra Brands ownership) were $1.73 billion.

Net voyage revenues and TCE rates are widely used by investors and analysts in the tanker shipping industry for comparing the financialperformance of companies and for preparing industry averages. We believe that our method of calculating net voyage revenue is consistent with industry standards. The table belowreconciles our net voyage revenues to voyage revenues. Years Ended December 31, All figures in USD ‘000, except TCE rate per day 2019 2018 Variance Voyage Revenue 317,220 289,016 9.8%Less Voyage expenses (141,770) (165,012) (14.1%)Net Voyage Revenue 175,450 124,004 41.5%Vessel Calendar Days (1) 8,395 9,747 (13.9%)Less off-hire days 293 277 5.8%Total TCE days 8,102 9,470 (14.4%)TCE Rate per day (2) $21,655 $13,095 65.4%)Total Days for vessel operating expenses 8,395 9,747 (13.9%)(1)Vessel Calendar Days is the total number of days the vessels were in our fleet.(2)Time Charter Equivalent (“TCE”) Rate, results from Net Voyage Revenue divided by total TCE days.The change in Voyage revenue is due to two main factors:i)The number of TCE daysii)The change in the TCE rate achieved.With regards to i), the decrease in vessel calendar days is mainly due to the disposal of ten vessels in 2018, offset by three 2018 Newbuildings delivered in the latter part of 2018.43\n\nWith regards to ii), the TCE rate increased by $8,560, or 65.4%. The indicative rates presented by Clarksons Shipping increased by 91.7% for the twelve months of 2019compared to the same twelve months in 2018 to $31,560 from $16,466, respectively. The rates presented by Clarksons Shipping were significantly influenced by the spike in the Suezmaxtanker rates in the fourth quarter of both 2019 and 2018. Our average TCE was also positively impacted by the increased tanker rates towards the end of 2019, but not to the same extentas the rates reported by Clarksons Shipping. We expect this spike to materialize to a larger extent in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the rates reported by Clarksons Shipping.As a result of i) and ii) net voyage revenues increased by 41.5% from $124.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to $175.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.Voyage expenses decreased to $141.8 million from $165.0 million, or 14.1%. The decrease in voyage expenses was primarily due to a decrease in vessel calendar days asdiscussed above.Vessel operating expenses decreased by $14.4 million, or 17.9%, from $80.4 million in 2018 to $66.0 million in 2019. This was primarily due to the decrease in our fleet as discussedabove. In cooperation with our technical managers we maintain our focus on keeping the fleet in top technical condition whilst keeping costs low.No impairment loss on vessels has been recorded in 2019 compared to a loss of $2.2 million recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018.General and administrative expenses increased $0.7 million, or 5.9%, from $12.7 million in 2018 to $13.5 million in 2019.Depreciation expenses increased by $3.3 million, or 5.4%, from $60.7 million in 2018 to $64.0 million in 2019. The increase is primarily due to the full-year effect of the threevessels added to the fleet in the latter part of 2018.Interest expenses increased by $3.8 million, or 11.1%, from $34.5 million in 2018 to $38.4 million in 2019. The increase is mainly due to the full year-effect of the loans associatedwith the three vessels added to the fleet in latter part of 2018 and a non-cash expense of about $1.7 million related to the remaining borrowing cost under the Credit Facility that wasrepaid on February 12, 2019.Other financial expenses decreased by $10.6, or 71.4%, from $14.8 million in 2018 to $4.2 million in 2019 mainly due an expense related to fair value change of $3.2 million forInvestment Securities, offset by the cancellation of the Backstop facility in 2018 and expense of the associated fees of $13.4 million.Please see Item 5.

What is the change to the classification for carrying amount of financial assets?,"['The following table summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the fiscal years ended January 31,\n\n2019 and 2018:\n\nJanuary 31, 2019\n\nJanuary 31, 2018\n\nGoodwill, beginning of the year\n\n$\n\n1,769.4\n\n$\n\n1,710.3\n\nLess: accumulated impairment losses, beginning of the year\n\n(149.2)\n\n(149.2)\n\nAdditions arising from acquisitions during the year\n\n866.9\n\n—\n\nEffect of foreign currency translation, measurement period adjustments, and other (1)\n\n(36.3)\n\n59.1\n\nGoodwill, end of the year\n\n$\n\n2,450.8\n\n$\n\n1,620.2\n\n_______________ (1) Purchase accounting adjustments reflect revisions made to the Company’s preliminary determination of estimated fair value of assets\n\nand liabilities assumed during fiscal 2019 and 2018.\n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nAt least annually or more frequently as circumstances dictate, Autodesk reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever impairment indicators exist. Autodesk continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate the carrying amounts of its long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, Autodesk assesses recoverability of these assets. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the carrying amounts of the assets to the future undiscounted cash flow the assets are expected to generate. If the long-lived assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. Autodesk did not recognize any material impairments of long-lived assets during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\n\nIn addition to the recoverability assessments, Autodesk routinely reviews the remaining estimated useful lives of its long-\n\nlived assets. Any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made, as well as in subsequent quarters.\n\nDeferred Tax Assets\n\nDeferred tax assets arise primarily from tax credits, net operating losses, and timing differences for reserves, accrued liabilities, stock options, deferred revenue, purchased technologies, and capitalized intangibles, partially offset by U.S. deferred tax liabilities on acquired intangibles, and valuation allowances against U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets. Autodesk performed a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets and believes it will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize the net deferred tax assets. They are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce gross deferred tax assets to the amount that is ""more likely than not"" to be realized.\n\nStock-based Compensation Expense\n\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, as\n\nfollows:\n\nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nCost of subscription and maintenance revenue\n\n$\n\n13.2\n\n$\n\n11.9\n\n$\n\n8.6\n\nCost of other revenue\n\n4.3\n\n4.0\n\n5.5\n\nMarketing and sales\n\n109.4\n\n107.3\n\n94.1\n\nResearch and development\n\n82.6\n\n82.9\n\n81.3\n\nGeneral and administrative\n\n40.0\n\n55.3\n\n32.3\n\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock awards and Employee Qualified\n\nStock Purchase Plan (""ESPP"") purchases\n\n249.5\n\n261.4\n\n221.8\n\nTax benefit\n\n(2.6)\n\n(2.6)\n\n(2.6)\n\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock awards and ESPP purchases,\n\nnet\n\n$\n\n246.9\n\n$\n\n258.8\n\n$\n\n219.2\n\n2019 Form 10-K 71\n\nt r o p e R\n\nl a u n n A 9 1 0 2\n\n2 0 1 9 A n n u a l\n\nR e p o r t\n\nAutodesk determines the grant date fair value of its share-based payment awards using a Black-Scholes Merton (""BSM"") option pricing model or the quoted stock price on the date of grant, unless the awards are subject to market conditions, in which case Autodesk uses a binomial-lattice model (e.g., Monte Carlo simulation model). The Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables to estimate the probability that market conditions will be achieved. Autodesk uses the following assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock-based awards:\n\nFiscal Year Ended\n\nFiscal Year Ended\n\nFiscal Year Ended\n\nJanuary 31, 2019\n\nJanuary 31, 2018\n\nJanuary 31, 2017\n\nStock Option Plans\n\nPerformance Stock Unit\n\nESPP\n\nPerformance Stock Unit\n\nESPP\n\nPerformance Stock Unit\n\nESPP\n\nRange of expected volatilities\n\n37 - 42%\n\n36%\n\n33 - 38%\n\n32%\n\n31 - 34%\n\n38 - 39%\n\n30 - 40%\n\nRange of expected lives\n\n(in years)\n\n0.5 - 3.8\n\nN/A\n\n0.5 - 2.0\n\nN/A\n\n0.5 - 2.0\n\nN/A\n\n0.5 - 2.0\n\nExpected dividends\n\n—%\n\n—%\n\n—%\n\n—%\n\n—%\n\n—%\n\n—%\n\nRange of risk-free interest rates\n\n2.3 - 2.7%\n\n2.0%\n\n1.9 - 2.8%\n\n1.0 - 1.2%\n\n0.9 - 1.4%\n\n0.6 - 0.7%\n\n0.5 - 0.9%\n\nAutodesk estimates expected volatility for stock-based awards based on the average of the following two measures: (1) a measure of historical volatility in the trading market for the Company’s common stock, and (2) the implied volatility of traded forward call options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. The expected volatility for performance stock units subject to market conditions includes the expected volatility of Autodesk\'s peer companies within the S&P Computer Software Select Index or S&P North American Technology Software Index with a market capitalization over $2.00 billion, depending on the award type.\n\nAutodesk estimates the expected life of stock-based awards using both exercise behavior and post-vesting termination\n\nbehavior as well as consideration of outstanding options. The range of expected lives of ESPP awards are based upon the four, six-month exercise periods within a 24-month offering period.\n\nAutodesk did not pay cash dividends in fiscal 2019, 2018, or 2017 and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in\n\nthe foreseeable future. Consequently, an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the BSM option pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation model.\n\nThe risk-free interest rate used in the BSM option pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation model for stock-based\n\nawards is the historical yield on U.S. Treasury securities with equivalent remaining lives.\n\nAutodesk recognizes expense only for the stock-based awards that ultimately vest. Autodesk accounts for forfeitures of\n\nstock-based awards as those forfeitures occur.\n\nAdvertising Expenses\n\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred.', 'operations and our ability to manage costs and working capital successfully. Additionally, our cash flow generation ability is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs. Further, our capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned if, for example, our revenues do not reach expected levels, or we have to incur unforeseen capital expenditures and make investments to maintain our competitive position. If this is the case, we may seek alternative financing, such as selling additional debt or equity securities, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on favorable terms, if at all. Moreover, if we issue new debt securities, the debt holders would have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. If we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities, existing stockholders may experience dilution, and such new securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms and conditions of additional financings unattractive. Our inability to raise capital could impede our growth or otherwise require us to forego growth opportunities and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our working capital:\n\nFor the Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n(Dollars in thousands)\n\nCash and cash equivalents Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts Inventories, net Prepaid expenses Other current assets Accounts payable Accrued expenses Current operating lease liabilities Total Working Capital\n\n9,472 18,581 12,542 3,276 10,453 (18,668) (22,133) (1,185) 12,338 $\n\n$\n\nWorking Capital consists of current assets net of current liabilities. Working capital decreased $0.4 million to $12.3 million at December 31, 2019 compared with $12.7 million at December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily a result of an increase of cash, accounts receivable, and inventory offset by an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and current operating lease liabilities.\n\nWe normally carry three to four weeks of finished goods inventory. The average duration of our accounts receivable is approximately 25 days.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 our capital resources consisted of primarily $9.5 million cash on hand and $33.0 million available under our credit facilities, net of $2.0 million reserved for two letters of credit. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our capital resources consisted primarily of $7.5 million cash on hand and $30.0 million available under our credit facilities.

The majority of our shell eggs are sold at independently quoted wholesale market prices for shell eggs or formulas related to our costs of production which include the cost of corn and soybean meal. The following table shows our net income (loss), gross profit, net average shell egg selling price, the average Urner Barry wholesale large shell egg prices in the southeast region, and feed cost per dozen produced for each of our three most recent fiscal years.\n\nFiscal Year ended\n\nJune 1, 2019\n\nJune 2, 2018\n\nJune 3, 2017\n\nNet income (loss) attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. - (in thousands) Gross profit (in thousands) Net average shell egg selling price (rounded) Average Urner Barry Spot Egg Market Quotations 1 Feed cost per dozen produced\n\n$\n\n54,229 $ 222,859 1.27 1.23 0.415\n\n125,932 $ 361,046 1.40 1.49 0.394\n\n(74,278) 45,550 1.01 0.85 0.399\n\n1- Average Thursday price for the large market (i.e. generic shell eggs) in the southeastern region\n\nThe shell egg industry has historically been subject to periods of high profitability followed by periods of significant loss. The periods of high profitability have often reflected increased consumer demand relative to supply while the periods of significant loss have often reflected excess supply for the then prevailing consumer demand. Historically, demand for shell eggs increases in line with overall population growth. As reflected above, our operating results fluctuate with changes in the spot egg market quote and feed costs. The net average shell egg selling price is the blended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs, including non-graded shell egg sales, breaking stock and undergrades. In fiscal 2017, our net average selling price and dozens sold decreased over the previous fiscal year primarily due to the oversupply of eggs resulting from the repopulation of the national flock of laying hens to levels exceeding the flock size prior to the avian influenza outbreak in 2015, along with a reduced demand for egg products. In fiscal 2018, strong demand resulted in an increase in our average selling price and dozens sold, and feed costs decreased over prior years. Fiscal 2019 saw an increasing U.S. flock size result in oversupply of eggs, particularly in the last half of the fiscal year. This resulted in decreased gross profit and net income for fiscal 2019.\n\n24\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFiscal Year Ended June 1, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 2, 2018\n\nNET SALES\n\nNet sales for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019 were $1,361.2 million, a decrease of $141.7 million, or 9.4%, from net sales of $1,502.9 million for fiscal 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower selling prices for non-specialty eggs in fiscal 2019 due to the oversupply of eggs, particularly in the last half of the fiscal year, contrasted with fiscal 2018 in which we experienced strong demand resulting in higher prices for non-specialty eggs.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, shell egg sales made up approximately 97% of our net sales. Total dozens sold in fiscal 2019 were 1,038.9 million, an increase of 1.2 million dozen, or 0.1%, compared to 1,037.7 million sold in fiscal 2018 resulting in an increase in net sales of $1.7 million for fiscal 2019 compared with the prior year.\n\nNet average selling price of shell eggs decreased from $1.397 per dozen for fiscal 2018 to $1.265 per dozen for fiscal 2019, a decrease of $0.132 per dozen, or 9.4%, primarily reflecting an abundance of eggs in the market. The decrease in sales price in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2018 resulted in a corresponding decrease in net sales of approximately $137.1 million. Our operating results are significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices, which are outside of our control. Small changes in production or demand levels can have a large effect on shell egg prices.\n\nEgg products accounted for approximately 3% of our net sales.

The additions for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019 and 2018 are primarily related to the impacts of the Tax Act and taxation of certain intercompany transactions. The additions for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 are primarily related to certain non-U.S. net operating loss carry forwards, previously offset with a valuation allowance, that can no longer be recognized due to an internal restructuring. The reductions from settlements with taxing authorities for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 are primarily related to the settlement of a U.S. audit.\n\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax\n\nexpense.

All of the NOL carryforward was incurred subsequent to the enactment of the TCJA and therefore has an indefinite carryforward period. The Company has significant deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to property, plant and equipment, which are expected to reverse and allow for the full utilization of the NOL carryforward. As such, the Company has not recorded a valuation allowance related to the NOL carryforward. Also included in the deferred tax assets are North Carolina Investing in Business Property Credit and North Carolina Jobs Credits totaling $4.9 million, as well as Georgia Job Tax Credits totaling $2.6 million. The North Carolina Investing in Business Property Credit provides a 7% investment tax credit for property located in a North Carolina development area, the North Carolina Creating Jobs Credit provides a tax credit for increased employment in North Carolina, and the Georgia Job Tax Credit provides a tax credit for creation and retention of qualifying jobs in Georgia. It is management’s opinion that the majority of the North Carolina and Georgia income tax credits will not be utilized before they expire, and a $5.6 million valuation allowance has been recorded as of October 31, 2019.

The Company has determined that credit risk largely depends on both the risk in the country where the customer resides (e.g. ability to make cross border payments) as well as the payment pattern of the customer. There- fore, expected credit losses (ECLs) are calculated using a provision matrix that specifies a fixed rate depending both on the number of days past due and the country risk rating. The country risk ratings depends on the ratings used by all Export Credit Agencies within the OECD. The rates defined in the provision matrix are based on historical loss patterns for that grouping of customers. These rates are adjusted for current conditions as well as management expec- tations for changes to political risks and payment patterns in the future. The provision rates are higher on high risk countries compared to low risk countries and also higher on amounts that remain unpaid for longer periods of time. There were no significant changes to the model during the year.\n\nTrade receivables and contract assets together amounted to SEK 55,240 (64,350) million as of December 31, 2019. Provisions for expected credit losses on trade receivables and contract assets amounted to SEK 2,983 (4,123) million as of December 31, 2019. The allowance decreased in 2019 due to improvement in cash collection resulting in significant reduction of total past due invoices. The Company’s write-offs have historically been low. During the year SEK 382 (890) million were written off due to the Company having no reasonable expectation of collection. Of these write-offs, SEK 0 (61) million are still subject to enforcement.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, the total amount payable to the Company under customer finance credits was SEK 5,924 (4,247) million. The carrying value of these assets was SEK 3,756 (2,883) million as of December 31, 2019, which represents the maximum exposure to credit risk on these assets. Customer finance is arranged for infrastructure projects in different geographic markets. As of December 31, 2019, there were a total of 80 (94) customer finance arrangements originated by or guaranteed by the Company. The five largest facilities represented 69% (62%) of the customer finance exposure in 2019. As of December 31, 2019, Middle East and Africa made up 49% (57%) of the oustanding exposure while South East Asia, Oceania and India made up 29% (15%). As of December 31, 2019, the Company also had unutilized customer finance commitments of SEK 25,854 (30,270) million.\n\nSecurity arrangements for customer finance facilities may include pledges of equipment, pledges of certain assets belonging to the borrower and pledges of shares in the operating company. If available, third-party risk coverage is, as a rule, arranged. “Third-party risk coverage” means that a financial payment guarantee covering the credit risk has been issued by a bank, an export credit agency or an insurance company. All such institutions have been rated at least investment grade. A credit risk transfer under a sub-participation arrange- ment with a bank can also be arranged. In this case the entire credit risk and the funding is taken care of by the bank for the part that they cover.\n\nInformation about financial guarantees related to customer finance is\n\nincluded in note D2, “Contingent liabilities.”\n\nThe table below summarizes the Company’s outstanding customer finance\n\nas of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\nMovements in allowances for impairment of trade receivables and contract assets\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nOutstanding customer finance credit risk exposure 1)\n\nOpening balance Decrease (–)/increase (+) in allowance Write-offs Translation difference Closing balance 1)\n\n1) Of which SEK 0 (15) million relates to contract assets.\n\n4,123 –737 –382 –21\n\n2,983\n\n4,575 420 –890 18\n\n4,123\n\nFair value of customer finance credits Financial guarantees for third-parties Accrued interest\n\nMaximum exposure to credit risk Less third-party risk coverage\n\n2019\n\n3,756 24 14\n\n3,794 –309\n\n2018\n\n2,883 42 21\n\n2,946 –331\n\nThe Company’s risk exposure, less third-party risk coverage\n\n3,485\n\n2,615\n\nThe distribution of trade receivables and contract assets closely follows the distribution of the Company’s sales, see note B1, “Segment information.” The ten largest customers represented 49% (53%) of the total trade receivables and contract assets in 2019.\n\nAging analysis of gross values by risk category at December 31, 2019\n\nDays past due\n\n1–90\n\n91–180\n\n181–360\n\n>360\n\nCountry risk: Low Country risk: Medium Country risk: High\n\n1,347 891 583\n\n125 725 365\n\n127 600 217\n\n313 819 1,315\n\nTotal past due\n\n2,821\n\n1,215\n\n944\n\n2,447\n\nCustomer finance credit risk All major commitments to finance customers are made only after approval in accordance with the work procedure for the Board of Directors and according to the established credit approval process.\n\nTotal\n\n1,912 3,035 2,480\n\n7,427\n\n1) This table has been adjusted to show the maximum exposure to credit risk.\n\nFair value assessment of customer finance credits Customer finance risk exposures are held at fair value and are classified as Level 3 on the fair value hierarchy. The Credit Asset Management Team within Ericsson Credit AB, reporting to Head of Group Treasury and Customer Finance, has established a process with respect to measurement of fair values. The quarterly credit review uses an internal model to determine a commercial rating for each credit and for calculation of the fair value. The model is based on exter- nal credit rating, political/country rating and bank pricing. Regular monitoring of customer behavior is also a part of the internal assessment. Revaluation of customer finance amounted to a net negative impact in the income statement of SEK 804 (1,073) million in 2019, of which SEK 804 (1,073) million is related to credits held as of December 31, 2019. This effect is presented within selling and administrative expenses and was mainly related to India and the Middle East, especially Iran and Iraq.\n\nPrior to the approval of new facilities reported as customer finance, an internal credit risk assessment is conducted in order to assess the credit rating of each transaction for political and commercial risk. The credit risk analysis is made by using an assessment tool, where the political risk rating is identical to the rating used by all Export Credit Agencies within the OECD. The commercial risk is assessed by analyzing a large number of parameters, which may affect the level of the future commercial credit risk exposure. The output from the assessment tool for the credit rating also includes an internal pricing of the risk. This is expressed as a risk margin per annum over funding cost.', 'NOTE 6—CONTRACT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\n\nContract assets include unbilled amounts typically resulting from sales under contracts when the percentage-of- completion cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition is utilized and revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer.

What is the income from Non-Swiss in 2017?,"['Table of Contents\n\nOther income and expense items are summarized in the following table:\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nInterest expense\n\n$\n\n(2,085) $\n\nInterest income\n\n1,826\n\nOther (expense) income\n\n(2,676)\n\nTotal other (expense) income, net\n\n$\n\n(2,935) $\n\nInterest expense decreased in the year ended December 31, 2018, versus the same period in 2017 primarily due to lower debt balances, a reduction in interest related to interest rate swaps, and a one-time charge related to a liability that was settled in 2017. Interest income increased due to higher interest rates. Other expense in the year ended December 31, 2018, was driven by foreign currency translation losses mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro. Other income in the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven mainly by foreign currency translation gains due to the depreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro.\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nEffective tax rate\n\n19.9%\n\nThe effective income tax rate in 2018 was 19.9% compared to 64.1% in the prior year. The tax rate in 2018 was favorably impacted by a discrete one-time rate change benefit related to the Tax Act resulting from the election of tax accounting method changes, partially offset by a one-time withholding tax on repatriation of earnings from one of our foreign subsidiaries that was completed during the year to enable the use of tax credits due to expire in 2018. The tax rate in 2017 was unfavorably impacted by the application of the Tax Act, driven by the remeasurement of the net deferred tax assets from 35% to 21% and the one-time mandatory transition tax on the historical earnings of foreign affiliates, which resulted in a net non-cash charge of $18,001.\n\nNet earnings were $46,532 or $1.39 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to earnings of $14,448 or $0.43 per diluted share in the comparable period of 2017.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $100,241 at December 31, 2019, and $100,933 at December 31, 2018, of which $98,309 and $96,762, respectively, were held outside the United States. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $692 was primarily driven by cash generated from operating activities of $64,405 and net proceeds from an increase in borrowings of long-term debt of $49,700, which were offset by the payment for the QTI acquisition of $73,906, capital expenditures of $21,733, treasury stock purchases of $11,746, dividends paid of $5,238, and taxes paid on behalf of equity award participants of $2,657. Total debt as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, was $99,700 and $50,000, respectively. Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, defined as long-term debt as a percentage of total debt and shareholders’ equity, was 19.7% at December 31, 2019, compared to 11.7% at December 31, 2018.\n\nWorking capital increased by $5,164 from December 31, 2018, to December 31, 2019, driven mainly by the decrease in accrued payroll and benefits due to lower short-term incentive compensation and the decrease in accounts payable, which were partially offset by an increase in operating lease obligations.\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $64,405 during the year ended December 31, 2019. Components of net cash provided by operating activities included net earnings of $36,146, depreciation and amortization expense of $24,619, stock-based compensation of $5,015, other net non-cash items totaling $5,160, and a net cash outflow from changes in assets and liabilities of $6,535.\n\nCTS CORPORATION 21\n\n(3,343)\n\n1,284\n\n3,817\n\n1,758\n\n64.', ' . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Autodesk continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate the carrying amounts of its long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, Autodesk assesses recoverability of these assets. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the carrying amounts of the assets to the future undiscounted cash flow the assets are expected to generate. If the long-lived assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. Autodesk did not recognize any material impairments of long-lived assets during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\n\nIn addition to the recoverability assessments, Autodesk routinely reviews the remaining estimated useful lives of its long-\n\nlived assets. Any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made, as well as in subsequent quarters.\n\nDeferred Tax Assets\n\nDeferred tax assets arise primarily from tax credits, net operating losses, and timing differences for reserves, accrued liabilities, stock options, deferred revenue, purchased technologies, and capitalized intangibles, partially offset by U.S. deferred tax liabilities on acquired intangibles, and valuation allowances against U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets. Autodesk performed a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets and believes it will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize the net deferred tax assets. They are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse.

The expected volatility for performance stock units subject to market conditions includes the expected volatility of Autodesk\'s peer companies within the S&P Computer Software Select Index or S&P North American Technology Software Index with a market capitalization over $2.00 billion, depending on the award type.\n\nAutodesk estimates the expected life of stock-based awards using both exercise behavior and post-vesting termination\n\nbehavior as well as consideration of outstanding options. The range of expected lives of ESPP awards are based upon the four, six-month exercise periods within a 24-month offering period.\n\nAutodesk did not pay cash dividends in fiscal 2019, 2018, or 2017 and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in\n\nthe foreseeable future. Consequently, an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the BSM option pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation model.\n\nThe risk-free interest rate used in the BSM option pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation model for stock-based\n\nawards is the historical yield on U.S. Treasury securities with equivalent remaining lives.\n\nAutodesk recognizes expense only for the stock-based awards that ultimately vest.

The increase in revenue wasprimarily attributable to increases in new customers, including approximately 4,000 new customers added since March 31, 2017, a full year of revenuerelated to new customers added during fiscal 2017 and additional revenue from customers that existed as of March 31, 2017. Revenue for the year endedMarch 31, 2018 compared to the year ended March 31, 2017 was positively impacted by approximately $4.7 million primarily as a result of the weakening ofthe U.S. dollar relative to the South African rand and to a lesser extent the British pound.Cost of revenue Year ended March 31, Period-to-period change 2018 2017 Amount % Change (dollars in thousands) Cost of revenue $69,699 $50,314 $19,385 39% 48', 'Table of Contents\n\nOther income and expense items are summarized in the following table:\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nInterest expense\n\n$\n\n(2,085) $\n\nInterest income\n\n1,826\n\nOther (expense) income\n\n(2,676)\n\nTotal other (expense) income, net\n\n$\n\n(2,935) $\n\nInterest expense decreased in the year ended December 31, 2018, versus the same period in 2017 primarily due to lower debt balances, a reduction in interest related to interest rate swaps, and a one-time charge related to a liability that was settled in 2017. Interest income increased due to higher interest rates. Other expense in the year ended December 31, 2018, was driven by foreign currency translation losses mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro. Other income in the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven mainly by foreign currency translation gains due to the depreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro.\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nEffective tax rate\n\n19.9%\n\nThe effective income tax rate in 2018 was 19.9% compared to 64.1% in the prior year. The tax rate in 2018 was favorably impacted by a discrete one-time rate change benefit related to the Tax Act resulting from the election of tax accounting method changes, partially offset by a one-time withholding tax on repatriation of earnings from one of our foreign subsidiaries that was completed during the year to enable the use of tax credits due to expire in 2018. The tax rate in 2017 was unfavorably impacted by the application of the Tax Act, driven by the remeasurement of the net deferred tax assets from 35% to 21% and the one-time mandatory transition tax on the historical earnings of foreign affiliates, which resulted in a net non-cash charge of $18,001.\n\nNet earnings were $46,532 or $1.39 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to earnings of $14,448 or $0.43 per diluted share in the comparable period of 2017.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $100,241 at December 31, 2019, and $100,933 at December 31, 2018, of which $98,309 and $96,762, respectively, were held outside the United States. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $692 was primarily driven by cash generated from operating activities of $64,405 and net proceeds from an increase in borrowings of long-term debt of $49,700, which were offset by the payment for the QTI acquisition of $73,906, capital expenditures of $21,733, treasury stock purchases of $11,746, dividends paid of $5,238, and taxes paid on behalf of equity award participants of $2,657. Total debt as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, was $99,700 and $50,000, respectively. Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, defined as long-term debt as a percentage of total debt and shareholders’ equity, was 19.7% at December 31, 2019, compared to 11.7% at December 31, 2018.\n\nWorking capital increased by $5,164 from December 31, 2018, to December 31, 2019, driven mainly by the decrease in accrued payroll and benefits due to lower short-term incentive compensation and the decrease in accounts payable, which were partially offset by an increase in operating lease obligations.\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $64,405 during the year ended December 31, 2019. Components of net cash provided by operating activities included net earnings of $36,146, depreciation and amortization expense of $24,619, stock-based compensation of $5,015, other net non-cash items totaling $5,160, and a net cash outflow from changes in assets and liabilities of $6,535.\n\nCTS CORPORATION 21\n\n(3,343)\n\n1,284\n\n3,817\n\n1,758\n\n64.', 'Other (Income) and Expense\n\n($ in millions)\n\nFor the year ended December 31:\n\nOther (income) and expense\n\nForeign currency transaction\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nYr.-to-Yr.

The Israeli corporate tax rate was 24% in the year 2017, and reduced to 23% in the year 2018 and onwards. Such tax rate changes had nosignificant impact on the Company's financial statements. The Company is taxed according to U.S. tax laws. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), which among other provisions, reduced the U.S. corporatetax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. The Act did not have an effect on the financial results and position of the Company. B.Deferred income taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financialreporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets are asfollows: December 31 2 0 1 9 2 0 1 8 U.S. $ in thousands Operating loss carryforward 73,260 57,768 Net deferred tax asset before valuation allowance 19,911 15,916 Valuation allowance (19,911) (15,916)Net deferred tax asset 795 772 As of December 31, 2019, the Company has provided a full valuation allowances of $19,911 in respect of deferred tax assets resulting fromtax loss carryforward and other temporary differences. Management currently believes that because the Company has a history of losses, it ismore likely than not that the deferred tax regarding the loss carryforward and other temporary differences will not be realized in theforeseeable future. C.Available carryforward tax losses: As of December 31, 2019, the Company has an accumulated tax loss carryforward of approximately $73,260. Carryforward tax losses inIsrael are of unlimited duration. Under the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, federal net operating losses (NOL) incurred in 2018and in future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal net operating losses is limited. It is uncertain ifand to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporationundergoes an “ownership change,” which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percent change, by value, in its equity ownership over athree-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. Such limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization. 69\n\nU.S. dollars in thousands(Except share data and exercise prices)Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements""]",The standard rate of corporation tax in the United Kingdom was 19.0% for the period mentioned in the information provided.,19.0%,1.0,0.8333333332916666,0.8333333332916666,1.0,0.9826263667092751

The assumptions used for the plans are based upon customary rates and practices for the location of the plans. Factors such as asset class allocations, long-term rates of return (actual and expected), and results of periodic asset liability modeling studies are considered when constructing the long-term rate of return assumption for our defined benefit pension plans.\n\nWeighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the plans at the end of each period were\n\nas follows:\n\nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nDiscount rate Rate of compensation increase\n\n2.0% 2.7%\n\n1.8% 2.6%\n\nIn selecting the appropriate discount rate for the plans, the Company uses country-specific information, adjusted to reflect\n\nthe duration of the particular plan. The discount rate was based on highly rated long-term bond indexes and yield curves that match the duration of the plan’s benefit obligations.\n\nDefined Contribution Plans\n\nAutodesk also provides defined contribution plans in certain foreign countries where required by statute. Autodesk’s funding policy for foreign defined contribution plans is consistent with the local requirements in each country. Autodesk’s contributions to these plans were $29.6 million in fiscal 2019, $27.2 million in fiscal 2018, and $26.6 million in fiscal 2017.\n\nCash Balance Plans\n\nAutodesk provides a cash balance plan that insures the risks of disability, death, and longevity, in which the vested\n\npension capital is reinvested and provides a 100% capital and interest guarantee. The weighted-average guaranteed interest crediting rate for cash balance plans was 1.0%, 1.0%, and 1.3% for mandatory retirement savings and 0.3%, 0.3%, and 0.8% for supplementary retirement savings for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\n\nOther Plans\n\nIn addition, Autodesk offers a non-qualified deferred compensation plan to certain key employees whereby they may defer a portion (or all) of their annual compensation until retirement or a different date specified by the employee in accordance with terms of the plan. See Note 7, “Deferred Compensation,” for further discussion.\n\n16. Restructuring and other exit costs, net\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Board of Directors approved a world-wide restructuring plan (“Fiscal 2018 Plan”) to support the Company's strategic priorities of completing the subscription transition, digitizing the Company, and re-imagining manufacturing, construction, and production. Through the restructuring, Autodesk seeks to reduce its investments in areas not aligned with its strategic priorities, including in areas related to research and development and go-to-market activities. At the same time, Autodesk plans to further invest in strategic priority areas related to digital infrastructure, customer success, and construction. By re-balancing resources to better align with the Company’s strategic priorities, Autodesk is positioning itself to meet its long-term goals. This world-wide restructuring plan included a reduction in force of approximately 11% of the Company’s workforce, or 1,027 employees, and the consolidation of certain leased facilities. By January 31, 2019, the personnel and facilities related actions included in this restructuring plan were substantially complete.\n\nDuring Fiscal 2019, restructuring charges under the Fiscal 2018 Plan included $39.2 million in employee termination\n\nbenefits and $3.2 million in lease termination and other exit costs.\n\n2019 Form 10-K 104\n\n2017\n\n1.7% 2.6%\n\nThe following tables set forth the restructuring charges and other facility exit costs, net during the fiscal years ended\n\nJanuary 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\nBalances, January 31, 2018\n\nAdditions\n\nPayments\n\nAdjustments (1)\n\nBalances, January 31, 2019\n\nFiscal 2018 Plan\n\nEmployee terminations costs\n\n$\n\n53.0\n\n$\n\n39.2\n\n$\n\n(89.7) $\n\n(0.5) $\n\n2.0\n\nFacility terminations and other exit costs\n\n2.5\n\n3.2\n\n(5.7)\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n55.5\n\n$\n\n42.4\n\n$\n\n(95.4) $\n\n(0.4) $\n\n2.1\n\nCurrent portion (2)\n\n$\n\n55.5\n\n$\n\n2.1\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n55.5\n\n$\n\n2.1\n\n____________________ (1) Adjustments primarily relate to the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, settlement of lease contracts, and certain write offs related\n\n(2)\n\nto fixed assets.

If assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The Scheme holds a significant proportion of growth assets (equities, diversified growth fund and global absolute return fund) which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term. The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Scheme’s long-term objectives.\n\nInflation risk\n\nA proportion of the Scheme’s benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation leads to higher liabilities (although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation). The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.\n\nChange in bond yields\n\nA decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the Scheme’s liabilities for accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Scheme’s bond holdings.\n\nLife expectancy\n\nThe majority of the Scheme’s obligations are to provide benefits for the lifetime of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.\n\nFunding requirements UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently. The ongoing funding valuation of the Scheme was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 30 April 2018 and showed a deficit of £0.2m. The Company paid deficit contributions of £70,000 for the year ending 31 March 2019 (2018: £70,000), and has committed to contribute £140,000 per annum from 1 April 2019, which is expected to make good this shortfall by 31 March 2020. The next funding valuation is due no later than 30 April 2021, at which progress towards full-funding will be reviewed. The Company also pays expenses and PPF levies incurred by the Scheme.\n\nAssumptions used The last triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme was performed by an independent professional actuary at 30 April 2018 using the projected unit method of valuation. For the purposes of IAS 19 (revised) the actuarial valuation as at 30 April 2018 has been updated on an approximate basis to 31 March 2019. There have been no changes in the valuation methodology adopted for this year’s disclosures compared to the prior year’s disclosures.\n\nThe principal financial assumptions used to calculate the liabilities under IAS 19 (revised) are as follows:\n\n2019 %\n\n2018 %\n\nDiscount rate for scheme liabilities\n\n2.45\n\n2.60\n\nCPI inflation\n\n2.35\n\n2.25\n\nRPI inflation\n\n3.45\n\n3.35\n\nPension increases\n\nPre 1988 GMP\n\n–\n\n–\n\nPost 1988 GMP\n\n2.10\n\n2.10\n\nPre 2004 non GMP\n\n5.00\n\n5.00\n\nPost 2004\n\n3.35\n\n3.25\n\nThe financial assumptions reflect the nature and term of the Scheme’s liabilities.\n\nThe Group has assumed that mortality will be in line with nationally published mortality table S2NA with CMI 2018 projections related to members’ years of birth with long-term rate of improvement of 1.5% per annum. These tables translate into an average life expectancy for a pensioner retiring at age 65 as follows:\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nMen Years\n\nWomen Years\n\nMen Years\n\nWomen Years\n\nMember aged 65 (current life expectancy)\n\n86.8\n\n88.9\n\n87.3\n\n89.3\n\nMember aged 45 (life expectancy at age 65)\n\n88.5\n\n90.7\n\n89.0\n\n91.1\n\nIt is assumed that 50% of non-retired members of the Scheme will commute the maximum amount of cash at retirement (2018: 50% of non-retired members of the Scheme will commute the maximum amount of cash at retirement).\n\n', 'Table of Contents\n\nAssumptions:\n\nThe following table provides the weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine the actuarial present value of\n\nprojected benefit obligations at:\n\nDomestic September 30,\n\nInternational September 30,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nDiscount rate: Expected return on plan assets: Rate of compensation increase:\n\n3.00 %\n\n4.00 %\n\n1.90 % 3.40 % — %\n\n2.90 % 3.80 % — %\n\nThe following table provides the weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost\n\nfor years ended:\n\nDomestic September 30,\n\nInternational September 30,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nDiscount rate: Expected return on plan assets: Rate of compensation increase:\n\n4.00 %\n\n3.75 %\n\n1.90 % 3.40 % — %\n\n2.80 % 3.70 % — %\n\nFor domestic plans, the discount rate was determined by comparison against the FTSE pension liability index for AA rated corporate instruments.

The international discount rates were determined by comparison against country specific AA corporate indices, adjusted for duration of the obligation.\n\nThe periodic benefit cost and the actuarial present value of projected benefit obligations are based on actuarial assumptions that are reviewed on an annual basis. The Company revises these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long- term trends, as well as market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits.\n\n67']","Factors such as asset class allocations, long-term rates of return (actual and expected), and results of periodic asset liability modeling studies are considered when constructing the long-term rate of return assumption for defined benefit pension plans.","Factors such as asset class allocations, long-term rates of return (actual and expected), and results of periodic asset liability modeling studies are considered when constructing the long-term rate of return assumption for our defined benefit pension plans.",1.0,0.9999999999666667,0.9999999999666667,1.0,0.9930950825667729

Volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was flat in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior-year period. This result reflected merchandising changes and price elasticity-related declines in certain brands, as well as isolated production challenges, partially offset by the continued benefit from momentum and innovation successes in the snacks businesses. Price/ mix was flat compared to the prior year as unfavorable mix, coupled with increases in brand building investments with retailers were offset by the impact of higher pricing. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC, which was completed in October 2017, contributed $41.3 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 results included $115.9 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $156.4 million of net sales related to this divested business.\n\nRefrigerated & Frozen net sales for fiscal 2019 were $2.80 billion, an increase of $51.0 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 1% increase in volume compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales volumes was a result of innovation across multiple brands, which was partially offset by the effects of reduced merchandising spend and the impact of a recall during the fourth quarter. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2018, as continued delivery of top-line accretive innovation in several brands was partially offset by brand building investments with retailers. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business, which was completed in February 2018, contributed $25.7 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition.\n\nInternational net sales for fiscal 2019 were $793.4 million, a decrease of $50.1 million, or 6%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 2% increase in volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, a 4% decrease due to foreign exchange rates, and a 2% increase in price/mix, in each case compared to fiscal 2018. The volume and price/ mix increases for fiscal 2019 were driven by growth in the Canadian snacks and frozen businesses. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $3.7 million to International net sales for fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 included $4.1 million of net sales related to our Del Monte® processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada, which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $48.9 million of net sales related to this divested business. In addition, fiscal 2019 and 2018 results included $17.1 million and $24.5 million, respectively, related to our divested Wesson® oil business.\n\nFoodservice net sales for fiscal 2019 were $934.2 million, a decrease of $120.6 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 14% decrease in volume, excluding divestitures. The decline in volume reflected the continued execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy and the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Price/mix increased 5% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in price/mix for fiscal 2019 reflected favorable product and customer mix, the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing, and the execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy. Fiscal 2019 included $34.2 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $53.4 million of net sales related to this divested business. Net sales declined by approximately 7% in fiscal 2019 due to the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility.\n\nPinnacle Foods net sales for fiscal 2019 (reflecting 213 days of Conagra Brands ownership) were $1.73 billion.

Credit Facility\n\nIn November 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the ‘‘2016 Credit Facility’’) with Silicon Valley Bank (‘‘SVB’’) as the lender. The 2016 Credit Facility provided a three-year, $25.0 million revolving credit facility, which included a maximum of $25.0 million letter of credit subfacility. Loan advances under the revolving facility were available of up to the full $25.0 million when the balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities minus outstanding revolving loans and letters of credit equaled or exceeded $50.0 million. If our net cash fell below $50.0 million, loan advances were determined based on a borrowing base equal to a specified percentage of the value of our eligible accounts receivable. Loans bore interest, at our option, at (i) the prime rate reported in The Wall Street Journal, minus 0.50% or (ii) a LIBOR rate determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility, plus 2.50%. Over the term of the 2016 Credit Facility, we paid customary closing fees, commitment fees and letter of credit fees for a facility of this size and type.\n\nIn September 2018, we entered into an amendment with SVB to reduce the unused revolving credit facility fee\n\non the 2016 Credit Facility from 0.4% to 0.3%.\n\nOur obligations under the 2016 Credit Facility were secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property. The 2016 Credit Facility required us to maintain compliance with customary affirmative and negative covenants, including compliance with an adjusted quick ratio of not less than 1.50:1.00, as determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility and restricted our ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions on our capital stock.\n\nOn November 1, 2019, the maturity date, we elected to allow the 2016 Credit Facility to expire without renewal. There were no outstanding loans or advances as of the maturity date. We currently have no plans for entering into a new borrowing facility.\n\n', ' Some of these limitations are: (a) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; (b) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (c) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; (d) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and (e) other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside our other GAAP-based financial\n\nperformance measures, net income and our other GAAP financial results.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nMarket risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates, as well as to a lesser extent, foreign exchange rates and inflation.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nWe are primarily exposed to changes in short-term interest rates with respect to our cost of borrowing under our 2017 Facility with SVB. We monitor our cost of borrowing under our various facilities, taking into account our funding requirements, and our expectation for short-term rates in the future. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, an increase or decrease in the interest rate on our 2017 Facility with SVB by 100 basis points would increase or decrease our annual interest expense by approximately $0.6 million and $0.7 million, respectively.\n\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\n\nBecause substantially all of our revenue and operating expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars, we do not believe that our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk is material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If a significant portion of our revenue and operating expenses becomes denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, we may not be able to effectively manage this risk, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by translation and by transactional foreign currency conversions.\n\nInflation Risk\n\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our\n\ncosts become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n', ""Table of Contents\n\nThe fair value measurements related to the Company's non-financial assets, such as intangible assets, assets held for sale\n\nand property, plant and equipment are based on available market prices at the measurement date based on transactions of similar assets and third-party independent appraisals, less costs to sell where appropriate. The Company classifies these measurements as Level 2.\n\nNote 7. Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nThe carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value because their maturity is less than three months. Management believes the carrying amount of the equity and cost-method investments materially approximated fair value at March 31, 2019 based upon unobservable inputs. The fair values of these investments have been determined as Level 3 fair value measurements. The fair values of the Company's line of credit borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements and approximate carrying value excluding debt issuance costs. Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities, the fair value of the Company's line of credit borrowings at March 31, 2019 approximated the carrying value and are considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described in Note 6. The carrying amount of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of the amounts and are considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nFair Value of Subordinated Convertible Debt, Senior Secured Notes, and Term Loan Facility\n\nThe Company measures the fair value of its senior and junior subordinated convertible debt and senior secured notes for\n\ndisclosure purposes. These fair values are based on observable market prices for this debt, which is traded in less active markets and are therefore classified as a Level 2 fair value measurement.\n\nThe following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's senior and junior subordinated\n\nconvertible debt, senior secured notes, and term loan facility as of March 31, 2019 and 2018 (in millions).\n\nMarch 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nCarrying Amount\n\nFair Value\n\nCarrying Amount\n\nFair Value\n\n2023 Senior Secured Notes\n\n$\n\n985.4\n\n$\n\n1,020.1\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\n2021 Senior Secured Notes\n\n$\n\n987.4\n\n$\n\n1,008.1\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nTerm Loan Facility\n\n$\n\n1,892.1\n\n$\n\n1,911.5\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\n2017 Senior Convertible Debt\n\n$\n\n1,493.6\n\n$\n\n2,285.4\n\n$\n\n1,437.6\n\n$\n\n2,459.2\n\n2015 Senior Convertible Debt\n\n$\n\n1,360.8\n\n$\n\n2,810.6\n\n$\n\n1,309.9\n\n$\n\n3,079.1\n\n2017 Junior Convertible Debt\n\n$\n\n335.9\n\n$\n\n740.8\n\n$\n\n326.7\n\n$\n\n876.9\n\n(1) The carrying amounts presented are net of debt discounts and debt issuance costs (see Note 12 Debt and Credit Facility for\n\nfurther information).\n\nNote 8.

What was the increase in FCC licenses in 2019?,"['/2019AnnualReport', '2019 Annual Report Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued\n\nThe balances of deferred contract costs included in our consolidated balance sheets were as follows:\n\n(dollars in millions)\n\nAt December 31, 2019\n\nAt December 31, 2018\n\nAssets\n\nPrepaid expenses and other\n\n$ 2,578\n\n$ 2,083\n\nOther assets\n\n1,911\n\n1,812\n\nTotal\n\n$ 4,489\n\n$ 3,895\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized expense of $2.7 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, associated with the amortization of deferred contract costs, primarily within Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.\n\nWe assess our deferred contract costs for impairment on a quarterly basis. We recognize an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount of a deferred cost exceeds the remaining amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the goods and services related to the cost, less the expected costs related directly to providing those goods and services that have not yet been recognized as expenses. There have been no impairment charges recognized for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\nNote 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures Spectrum License Transactions\n\nSince 2017, we have entered into or completed several strategic spectrum transactions including:\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of AT&T Inc. (AT&T) to exchange certain Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) and Personal Communication Services (PCS) spectrum licenses. This non-cash exchange was completed in February 2017. As a result, we received $1.0 billion of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and recorded a pre-tax gain of $126 million in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2017, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of Sprint Corporation to exchange certain PCS spectrum licenses. This non-cash exchange was completed in May 2017. As a result, we received $132 million of PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and recorded an insignificant gain in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of T-Mobile USA Inc. to exchange certain AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. This non-cash exchange was completed in December 2017. As a result, we received $414 million of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and recorded a pre-tax gain of $143 million in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\nDuring 2018, we entered into and completed various wireless license transactions, including the purchase of Straight Path Communications Inc. (Straight Path) and NextLink Wireless LLC (NextLink).\n\nDuring 2019, the FCC completed two millimeter wave spectrum license auctions. Verizon participated in these auctions and was the high bidder on 9 and 1,066 licenses, respectively, in the 24 Gigahertz (GHz) and 28 GHz bands. We submitted an application to the FCC and paid cash of approximately $521 million for the licenses. We received the licenses during the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\nDuring 2019, we entered into and completed various other wireless license acquisitions for an insignificant amount of cash consideration.\n\nIn December 2019, the FCC incentive auction for spectrum licenses in the upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz bands commenced. As an incumbent licensee, Verizon received vouchers related to our existing 39 GHz licenses. These vouchers can be converted into cash, the amount of which will not be known until the conclusion of the auction, or applied toward the purchase price of spectrum in the auction. At the conclusion of the auction, all existing licenses will be cancelled and new reconfigured licenses or cash will be distributed depending on the results of the auction. Due to the FCC’s rules restricting communications regarding the auction, we will not disclose our financial plans for the auction during the quiet period for this auction unless legally required. In addition, as of this time, until the completion of the auction process, we cannot determine the resulting financial outcome, including a potential gain or loss. Such gain or loss, if any, may be material.\n\nAcquisition of AOL Inc.\n\nIn May 2015, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with AOL Inc. (AOL) pursuant to which we commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of AOL at a price of $50.00 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.\n\nOn June 23, 2015, we completed the tender offer and merger, and AOL became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the closing of these transactions was approximately $3.8 billion. Holders of\n\nVerizon Communications Inc.', 'HC2 HOLDINGS, INC.

Providing the Company acts within the requirements and constraints of the regulatory authorities, the renewal and extension of these licenses is reasonably certain at minimal costs. Accordingly, we have concluded that the acquired FCC licenses are indefinite-lived intangible assets.\n\nIn 2019, FCC licenses increased $15.6 million, $18.2 million of which was through acquisitions, offset by $2.3 million of impairments and $0.3 million loss on the sale of licenses. Our Broadcasting segment recorded the impairment as a result of its decision to forfeit FCC licenses in certain lower-ranked markets, and does not expect any significant changes to future cash flows as a result of these forfeitures.
