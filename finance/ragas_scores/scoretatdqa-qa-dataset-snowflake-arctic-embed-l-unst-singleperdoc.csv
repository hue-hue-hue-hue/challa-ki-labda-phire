For 2017:
- Revenue: Not provided.
- Gross margin (2017): $7,427 million.
- Operating income (2017): $2,756 million.
- Therefore, Cost of Revenue (2017) = Revenue - Gross Margin = (Not provided) - $7,427 million.

For 2018:
- Revenue: $12,844 million.
- Gross margin (2018): $7,922 million.
- Therefore, Cost of Revenue (2018) = Revenue - Gross Margin = $12,844 million - $7,922 million = $4,922 million.

To find the proportion of cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue for 2018:
Cost of Revenue (2018) / Revenue (2018) = $4,922 million / $12,844 million ≈ 38.3%.

Unfortunately, the revenue for 2017 is not provided, so I cannot calculate the proportion for that year.","55%, 50%",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9333333333333333,0.0

Credit Facility\n\nIn November 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the ‘‘2016 Credit Facility’’) with Silicon Valley Bank (‘‘SVB’’) as the lender. The 2016 Credit Facility provided a three-year, $25.0 million revolving credit facility, which included a maximum of $25.0 million letter of credit subfacility. Loan advances under the revolving facility were available of up to the full $25.0 million when the balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities minus outstanding revolving loans and letters of credit equaled or exceeded $50.0 million. If our net cash fell below $50.0 million, loan advances were determined based on a borrowing base equal to a specified percentage of the value of our eligible accounts receivable. Loans bore interest, at our option, at (i) the prime rate reported in The Wall Street Journal, minus 0.50% or (ii) a LIBOR rate determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility, plus 2.50%. Over the term of the 2016 Credit Facility, we paid customary closing fees, commitment fees and letter of credit fees for a facility of this size and type.\n\nIn September 2018, we entered into an amendment with SVB to reduce the unused revolving credit facility fee\n\non the 2016 Credit Facility from 0.4% to 0.3%.\n\nOur obligations under the 2016 Credit Facility were secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property. The 2016 Credit Facility required us to maintain compliance with customary affirmative and negative covenants, including compliance with an adjusted quick ratio of not less than 1.50:1.00, as determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility and restricted our ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions on our capital stock.\n\nOn November 1, 2019, the maturity date, we elected to allow the 2016 Credit Facility to expire without renewal. There were no outstanding loans or advances as of the maturity date. We currently have no plans for entering into a new borrowing facility.\n\n', 'Supplementary Financial Data (Unaudited) (in millions, except per-share amounts)\n\nQuarters Ended Revenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Gross margin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Operating income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income per share - basic . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income per share - diluted . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Cash dividends declared per common share. . . . . . . . . . . $ Cash and cash equivalents and investments . . . . . . . . . . . $\n\nJuly 27, 2019 (1) April 27, 2019\n\n13,428 $ 8,574 $ 3,690 $ 2,206 $ 0.52 $ 0.51 $ 0.35 $ 33,413 $\n\n12,958 $ 8,173 $ 3,513 $ 3,044 $ 0.70 $ 0.69 $ 0.35 $ 34,643 $\n\nJanuary 26, 2019 12,446 7,773 3,211 2,822 0.63 0.63 0.33 40,383\n\nOctober 27, 2018 13,072 $ 8,146 $ 3,805 $ 3,549 $ 0.78 $ 0.77 $ 0.33 $ 42,593 $\n\nQuarters Ended Revenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Gross margin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Operating income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income (loss) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income (loss) per share - basic . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income (loss) per share - diluted. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Cash dividends declared per common share . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Cash and cash equivalents and investments . . . . . . . . . . . . . $\n\nJuly 28, 2018 (2)\n\n12,844 $ 7,922 $ 3,346 $ 3,803 $ 0.81 $ 0.81 $ 0.33 $ 46,548 $\n\nApril 28, 2018\n\n12,463 $ 7,759 $ 3,134 $ 2,691 $ 0.56 $ 0.56 $ 0.33 $ 54,431 $\n\nJanuary 27, 2018 (3) October 28, 2017 12,136 $ 11,887 7,427 $ 7,498 2,756 3,073 $ 2,394 (8,778) $ 0.48 (1.78) $ 0.48 (1.78) $ 0.29 $ 0.29 71,588 $ 73,683\n\n(1) In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we recorded an $872 million charge which was the reversal of the previously recorded benefit associated with the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends recorded in fiscal 2018 as a result of a retroactive final U.S. Treasury regulation issued during the quarter.\n\n(2) In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded adjustments to the provisional amounts related to the U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and re-measurement of net deferred tax assets.

Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, consisting of net loss of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $26.2 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $16.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $10.0 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an outflow from the changes in accrued liabilities and other of $5.9 million and inventory of $5.6 million, partially offset by an inflow from changes in deferred revenue of $3.2 million.\n\nThe unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and other was driven by an increase in lease liabilities associated with the lease of the San Jose corporate office. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to build up of inventory and timing of shipments, partially offset by increased reserves. The favorable change in deferred revenues was primarily driven by increased bookings.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million, consisting of net loss of $27.6 million which includes payments for our internal investigation costs of $8.6 million, non-cash charges of $25.0 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.9 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $3.1 million, offset primarily by an outflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $6.1 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and inventory of $1.5 million.\n\nThe favorable change in deferred revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the sale of subscription and support. The favorable change in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, increased value added tax accrual due to timing of payments, and an increase in legal fees accrual. The unfavorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections. The unfavorable change in prepaid and other assets was mainly driven by the increase in deferred sales commissions due to higher deferred revenue and higher average commission rate. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to the timing of shipments.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $14.3 million, consisting of a net loss of $10.8 million, a cash decrease resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million and non-cash charges of $26.4 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $17.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance of $1.1 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $12.4 million and deferred revenue of $3.0 million, and an outflow from the change in accrued liabilities of $8.9 million, inventory of $4.7 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and accounts payable of $0.9 million.\n\n', ' and Subsidiaries 2019 Annual Report 57']","In 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, consisting of a net loss of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $26.2 million, and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million.

The service conditionrequires participants to be employed on May 15th of the following year once the performance condition has been met. Depending on the actual performanceachieved, a participant may earn between 0% to 300% of the targeted shares for each tranche, which is determined based on a straight-line interpolation appliedfor the achievement between the specified performance ranges.

Additionally, our cash flow generation ability is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs. Further, our capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned if, for example, our revenues do not reach expected levels, or we have to incur unforeseen capital expenditures and make investments to maintain our competitive position. If this is the case, we may seek alternative financing, such as selling additional debt or equity securities, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on favorable terms, if at all. Moreover, if we issue new debt securities, the debt holders would have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. If we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities, existing stockholders may experience dilution, and such new securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms and conditions of additional financings unattractive.

Volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was flat in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior-year period. This result reflected merchandising changes and price elasticity-related declines in certain brands, as well as isolated production challenges, partially offset by the continued benefit from momentum and innovation successes in the snacks businesses. Price/ mix was flat compared to the prior year as unfavorable mix, coupled with increases in brand building investments with retailers were offset by the impact of higher pricing. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC, which was completed in October 2017, contributed $41.3 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 results included $115.9 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $156.4 million of net sales related to this divested business.\n\nRefrigerated & Frozen net sales for fiscal 2019 were $2.80 billion, an increase of $51.0 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 1% increase in volume compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales volumes was a result of innovation across multiple brands, which was partially offset by the effects of reduced merchandising spend and the impact of a recall during the fourth quarter. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2018, as continued delivery of top-line accretive innovation in several brands was partially offset by brand building investments with retailers. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business, which was completed in February 2018, contributed $25.7 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition.\n\nInternational net sales for fiscal 2019 were $793.4 million, a decrease of $50.1 million, or 6%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 2% increase in volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, a 4% decrease due to foreign exchange rates, and a 2% increase in price/mix, in each case compared to fiscal 2018. The volume and price/ mix increases for fiscal 2019 were driven by growth in the Canadian snacks and frozen businesses. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $3.7 million to International net sales for fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 included $4.1 million of net sales related to our Del Monte® processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada, which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $48.9 million of net sales related to this divested business. In addition, fiscal 2019 and 2018 results included $17.1 million and $24.5 million, respectively, related to our divested Wesson® oil business.\n\nFoodservice net sales for fiscal 2019 were $934.2 million, a decrease of $120.6 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 14% decrease in volume, excluding divestitures. The decline in volume reflected the continued execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy and the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Price/mix increased 5% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in price/mix for fiscal 2019 reflected favorable product and customer mix, the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing, and the execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy. Fiscal 2019 included $34.2 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $53.4 million of net sales related to this divested business.

The cases were consolidated into In re: Processed Egg Products Antitrust Litigation, No. 2:08-md-02002-GP, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the “District Court”), in three groups of cases - the “Direct Purchaser Putative Class Action”, the “Indirect Purchaser Putative Class Action” and the “Non-Class Cases.”\n\nThe Direct Purchaser Putative Class Action. The named plaintiffs in these cases alleged that they purchased eggs or egg products directly from a defendant and sued on behalf of themselves and a putative class of others who claimed to be similarly situated. As previously reported, in November 2014, the District Court approved the Company’s settlement with the direct purchaser plaintiff class and entered final judgment dismissing with prejudice the class members’ claims against the Company.\n\nThe Indirect Purchaser Putative Class Action. The named plaintiffs in these cases are individuals or companies who allege that they purchased shell eggs indirectly from one or more of the defendants - that is, they purchased from retailers that had previously purchased from defendants or other parties - and sued on behalf of themselves and a putative class of others who claim to be similarly situated. The District Court denied the indirect purchaser plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.

What was the net change in the other income (expense) in 2018?,"['Table of Contents\n\nOther income and expense items are summarized in the following table:\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nInterest expense\n\n$\n\n(2,085) $\n\nInterest income\n\n1,826\n\nOther (expense) income\n\n(2,676)\n\nTotal other (expense) income, net\n\n$\n\n(2,935) $\n\nInterest expense decreased in the year ended December 31, 2018, versus the same period in 2017 primarily due to lower debt balances, a reduction in interest related to interest rate swaps, and a one-time charge related to a liability that was settled in 2017. Interest income increased due to higher interest rates. Other expense in the year ended December 31, 2018, was driven by foreign currency translation losses mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro. Other income in the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven mainly by foreign currency translation gains due to the depreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro.\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nEffective tax rate\n\n19.9%\n\nThe effective income tax rate in 2018 was 19.9% compared to 64.1% in the prior year. The tax rate in 2018 was favorably impacted by a discrete one-time rate change benefit related to the Tax Act resulting from the election of tax accounting method changes, partially offset by a one-time withholding tax on repatriation of earnings from one of our foreign subsidiaries that was completed during the year to enable the use of tax credits due to expire in 2018. The tax rate in 2017 was unfavorably impacted by the application of the Tax Act, driven by the remeasurement of the net deferred tax assets from 35% to 21% and the one-time mandatory transition tax on the historical earnings of foreign affiliates, which resulted in a net non-cash charge of $18,001.\n\nNet earnings were $46,532 or $1.39 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to earnings of $14,448 or $0.43 per diluted share in the comparable period of 2017.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $100,241 at December 31, 2019, and $100,933 at December 31, 2018, of which $98,309 and $96,762, respectively, were held outside the United States. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $692 was primarily driven by cash generated from operating activities of $64,405 and net proceeds from an increase in borrowings of long-term debt of $49,700, which were offset by the payment for the QTI acquisition of $73,906, capital expenditures of $21,733, treasury stock purchases of $11,746, dividends paid of $5,238, and taxes paid on behalf of equity award participants of $2,657. Total debt as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, was $99,700 and $50,000, respectively. Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, defined as long-term debt as a percentage of total debt and shareholders’ equity, was 19.7% at December 31, 2019, compared to 11.7% at December 31, 2018.\n\nWorking capital increased by $5,164 from December 31, 2018, to December 31, 2019, driven mainly by the decrease in accrued payroll and benefits due to lower short-term incentive compensation and the decrease in accounts payable, which were partially offset by an increase in operating lease obligations.\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $64,405 during the year ended December 31, 2019. Components of net cash provided by operating activities included net earnings of $36,146, depreciation and amortization expense of $24,619, stock-based compensation of $5,015, other net non-cash items totaling $5,160, and a net cash outflow from changes in assets and liabilities of $6,535.\n\nCTS CORPORATION 21\n\n(3,343)\n\n1,284\n\n3,817\n\n1,758\n\n64.', 'Supplementary Financial Data (Unaudited) (in millions, except per-share amounts)\n\nQuarters Ended Revenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Gross margin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Operating income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income per share - basic . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income per share - diluted . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Cash dividends declared per common share. . . . . . . . . . . $ Cash and cash equivalents and investments . . . . . . . . . . . $\n\nJuly 27, 2019 (1) April 27, 2019\n\n13,428 $ 8,574 $ 3,690 $ 2,206 $ 0.52 $ 0.51 $ 0.35 $ 33,413 $\n\n12,958 $ 8,173 $ 3,513 $ 3,044 $ 0.70 $ 0.69 $ 0.35 $ 34,643 $\n\nJanuary 26, 2019 12,446 7,773 3,211 2,822 0.63 0.63 0.33 40,383\n\nOctober 27, 2018 13,072 $ 8,146 $ 3,805 $ 3,549 $ 0.78 $ 0.77 $ 0.33 $ 42,593 $\n\nQuarters Ended Revenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Gross margin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Operating income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income (loss) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income (loss) per share - basic . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income (loss) per share - diluted. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Cash dividends declared per common share . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Cash and cash equivalents and investments . . . . . . . . . . . . . $\n\nJuly 28, 2018 (2)\n\n12,844 $ 7,922 $ 3,346 $ 3,803 $ 0.81 $ 0.81 $ 0.33 $ 46,548 $\n\nApril 28, 2018\n\n12,463 $ 7,759 $ 3,134 $ 2,691 $ 0.56 $ 0.56 $ 0.33 $ 54,431 $\n\nJanuary 27, 2018 (3) October 28, 2017 12,136 $ 11,887 7,427 $ 7,498 2,756 3,073 $ 2,394 (8,778) $ 0.48 (1.78) $ 0.48 (1.78) $ 0.29 $ 0.29 71,588 $ 73,683\n\n(1) In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we recorded an $872 million charge which was the reversal of the previously recorded benefit associated with the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends recorded in fiscal 2018 as a result of a retroactive final U.S. Treasury regulation issued during the quarter.\n\n(2) In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded adjustments to the provisional amounts related to the U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and re-measurement of net deferred tax assets.

These adjustments included an $863 million benefit to the U.S. transition tax provisional amount related to the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends in the transition fiscal year.\n\n(3) In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a provisional tax expense of $11.1 billion related to the Tax Act, comprised of $9.0 billion of U.S. transition tax, $1.2 billion of foreign withholding tax, and $0.9 billion re-measurement of net DTA.\n\nItem 9.\n\nChanges in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures\n\nNone.\n\nItem 9A.\n\nControls and Procedures\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nBased on our management’s evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act”)) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nManagement’s report on our internal control over financial reporting and the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our internal control over financial reporting are set forth, respectively, on page 57 under the caption “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting” and on page 55 of this report.\n\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n', 'Stock Awards\n\nWe have granted RSUs to our employees, consultants and members of our Board of Directors, and PSUs to\n\ncertain executives.\n\nIn February 2016, we granted 547,000 PSUs with certain financial and operational targets. Actual performance, as measured at the time and prior to the restatement of the 2016 financial statements, resulted in participants achieving 80% of target. Given the PSUs did not contain explicit or implicit claw back rights, there was no change to stock-based compensation expense for the impact of the previously disclosed restatement of the 2016 consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2019, 253,203 shares had vested, 200,297 shares had been forfeited, and the remaining 93,500 shares will vest (as to 80%) in annual tranches through February 2020 subject to continued service vesting requirements.\n\nIn October 2018, we granted 464,888 PSUs with certain financial targets. These PSUs will become eligible to vest at 75% upon the achievement of the performance targets by December 31, 2020, and are subject to service condition vesting requirements. The remaining 25% of these PSUs will become eligible to vest on the first anniversary of the initial vesting date. None of these PSUs were vested as of December 31, 2019.\n\nIn April 2019, we granted 346,453 PSUs with certain financial targets. These PSUs will become eligible to vest at 75% on the second month following achievement of certain performance targets by December 31, 2021, with the remaining 25% of the PSUs to vest on the first anniversary of the initial vesting date, subject to continued service vesting requirements. None of these PSUs were vested as of December 31, 2019.\n\nIn December 2019, we granted 375,000 PSUs with certain market performance-based targets to be achieved between December 2019 and December 2023. One-third of each tranche of these PSUs will become eligible to vest on each of the three anniversaries of the date the performance-based target is achieved, subject to continued service vesting requirements. The grant date fair values of each tranche of these PSUs were estimated to be $4.59, $4.06 and $3.59 and determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model with the following assumptions: expected term of 4.0 years, expected volatility of 38.45%, risk-free interest rate of 1.7% and expected dividend yield of 0.0%.

Net Loss Per Share\n\nBasic net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.

None of the LOCs are recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nEgg Antitrust Litigation\n\nOn September 25, 2008, the Company was named as one of several defendants in numerous antitrust cases involving the United States shell egg industry. The cases were consolidated into In re: Processed Egg Products Antitrust Litigation, No. 2:08-md-02002-GP, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the “District Court”), in three groups of cases - the “Direct Purchaser Putative Class Action”, the “Indirect Purchaser Putative Class Action” and the “Non-Class Cases.”\n\nThe Direct Purchaser Putative Class Action. The named plaintiffs in these cases alleged that they purchased eggs or egg products directly from a defendant and sued on behalf of themselves and a putative class of others who claimed to be similarly situated. As previously reported, in November 2014, the District Court approved the Company’s settlement with the direct purchaser plaintiff class and entered final judgment dismissing with prejudice the class members’ claims against the Company.\n\nThe Indirect Purchaser Putative Class Action. The named plaintiffs in these cases are individuals or companies who allege that they purchased shell eggs indirectly from one or more of the defendants - that is, they purchased from retailers that had previously purchased from defendants or other parties - and sued on behalf of themselves and a putative class of others who claim to be similarly situated. The District Court denied the indirect purchaser plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. On June 28, 2018, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the indirect purchaser plaintiffs, for an immaterial amount, and on July 17, 2018, the Court entered an order dismissing all indirect purchaser plaintiffs’ claims against the Company and other defendants.\n\nThe Non-Class Cases. In the remaining cases, the named plaintiffs allege that they purchased shell eggs and egg products directly from one or more of the defendants but sue only for their own alleged damages and not on behalf of a putative class. On April 4, 2018, the Court entered a final judgement dismissing all claims against the Company brought by the following non-class plaintiffs: The Kroger Co.; Publix Super Markets, Inc.; SUPERVALU, Inc.; Safeway, Inc.; Albertsons LLC; H.E. Butt Grocery Co.; The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, Inc.; Walgreen Co.; Hy- Vee, Inc.; and Giant Eagle, Inc., with prejudice, pursuant to the Company’s previously announced $80.8 million settlement with the named plaintiffs.\n\nThe Company settled all Non-Class cases except for the claims of certain plaintiffs who sought substantial damages allegedly arising from the purchase of egg products (as opposed to shell eggs). As previously reported, the Company settled all claims brought by one of these plaintiffs, Conopco, Inc. on a confidential basis and for an amount that did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or results, and on November 21, 2018, the Court entered a final judgment dismissing Conopco’s claims against the Company. The remaining plaintiffs are Kraft Food Global, Inc., General Mills, Inc., Nestle USA, Inc., and The Kellogg Company (“Egg Products Plaintiffs”)."", ' As of August 31, 2019, the indefinitely reinvested earnings in foreign subsidiaries upon which taxes had not been provided were approximately $1.9 billion.

What is the company's main cost of revenue?,"['Table of Contents\n\nrevenue consists of personnel costs for our technical support team. Our cost of services revenue primarily consists of personnel costs for our professional serviceemployees, third-party contractors, and travel-related costs. In instances where we have primary responsibility for the delivery of services, subcontractor fees areexpensed as cost of services revenue. In each case, personnel costs include salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation.We allocate overhead such as information technology support, information security, facilities, and other administrative costs to all functional departmentsbased on headcount. As such, these general overhead expenses are reflected in cost of revenue and each functional operating expense.Cost of Revenue: Fiscal years ended July 31, 2019 2018 Change Amount % of totalrevenue Amount % of totalrevenue ($) (%) (In thousands, except percentages)Cost of revenue: License and subscription$64,798 9% $35,452 5% 29,346 83Maintenance16,499 2 14,783 2 1,716 12Services243,053 34 246,548 38 (3,495) (1)Total cost of revenue$324,350 45% $296,783 45% 27,567 9 Includes stock-based compensation of: Cost of license and subscription revenue$3,011 $1,002 2,009 Cost of maintenance revenue1,820 1,886 (66) Cost of services revenue22,781 21,856 925 Total$27,612 $24,744 2,868 The $29.3 million increase in our cost of license and subscription revenue was primarily attributable to increases of $14.9 million in personnel expenses, $8.6million in cloud infrastructure costs incurred in order to support the growth of our subscription offerings, $3.3 million in royalties, $1.8 million in professionalservices, and $0.9 million related to the amortization of internal-use software development and acquired intangible assets. Cloud infrastructure costs include $9.5million of hosting related costs that were recorded in cost of services revenue in fiscal year 2018. The treatment of these hosting related costs is consistent with thetreatment of the related revenue in each fiscal year.We anticipate higher cost of license and subscription revenue as we continue to invest in our cloud operations to increase operational efficiency and scalewhile growing our customer base.Cost of maintenance revenue increased by $1.7 million primarily due to the increase in personnel required to support our term and perpetual licensecustomers.Our cost of services revenue would have increased if cloud infrastructure costs totaling $9.5 million were not reclassified to cost of license and subscriptionrevenue, consistent with the treatment of the related revenue. Excluding the impact of this reclassification, third-party consultants billable to customers primarilyfor InsuranceNow implementation engagements increased by $3.2 million and personnel expenses related to new and existing employees increased by $2.8million.We had 781 professional service employees and 198 technical support and licensing operations employees at July 31, 2019 compared to 838 professionalservices employees and 121 technical support and licensing operations employees at July 31, 2018.', 'Supplementary Financial Data (Unaudited) (in millions, except per-share amounts)\n\nQuarters Ended Revenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Gross margin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Operating income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income per share - basic . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income per share - diluted . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Cash dividends declared per common share. . . . . . . . . . . $ Cash and cash equivalents and investments . . . . . . . . . . . $\n\nJuly 27, 2019 (1) April 27, 2019\n\n13,428 $ 8,574 $ 3,690 $ 2,206 $ 0.52 $ 0.51 $ 0.35 $ 33,413 $\n\n12,958 $ 8,173 $ 3,513 $ 3,044 $ 0.70 $ 0.69 $ 0.35 $ 34,643 $\n\nJanuary 26, 2019 12,446 7,773 3,211 2,822 0.63 0.63 0.33 40,383\n\nOctober 27, 2018 13,072 $ 8,146 $ 3,805 $ 3,549 $ 0.78 $ 0.77 $ 0.33 $ 42,593 $\n\nQuarters Ended Revenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Gross margin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Operating income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income (loss) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income (loss) per share - basic . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income (loss) per share - diluted. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Cash dividends declared per common share . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Cash and cash equivalents and investments . . . . . . . . . . . . . $\n\nJuly 28, 2018 (2)\n\n12,844 $ 7,922 $ 3,346 $ 3,803 $ 0.81 $ 0.81 $ 0.33 $ 46,548 $\n\nApril 28, 2018\n\n12,463 $ 7,759 $ 3,134 $ 2,691 $ 0.56 $ 0.56 $ 0.33 $ 54,431 $\n\nJanuary 27, 2018 (3) October 28, 2017 12,136 $ 11,887 7,427 $ 7,498 2,756 3,073 $ 2,394 (8,778) $ 0.48 (1.78) $ 0.48 (1.78) $ 0.29 $ 0.29 71,588 $ 73,683\n\n(1) In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we recorded an $872 million charge which was the reversal of the previously recorded benefit associated with the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends recorded in fiscal 2018 as a result of a retroactive final U.S. Treasury regulation issued during the quarter.\n\n(2) In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded adjustments to the provisional amounts related to the U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and re-measurement of net deferred tax assets.

The net increase in the total valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 is primarily related to the increase of a net operating loss carry forward due to a release of a non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefit and the increase of deferred tax assets in sites with existing valuation allowances. The decrease in domestic federal and state tax credits is primarily related to the utilization of tax credits against the one-time transition tax.\n\nAs of August 31, 2019, the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the remaining earnings from its foreign\n\nsubsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not already been recorded.

The additions for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019 and 2018 are primarily related to the impacts of the Tax Act and taxation of certain intercompany transactions. The additions for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 are primarily related to certain non-U.S. net operating loss carry forwards, previously offset with a valuation allowance, that can no longer be recognized due to an internal restructuring. The reductions from settlements with taxing authorities for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 are primarily related to the settlement of a U.S. audit.\n\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax\n\nexpense. The Company’s accrued interest and penalties were approximately $18.9 million and $20.4 million as of August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company recognized interest and penalties of approximately $(1.5) million, $(6.7) million and $5.2 million during the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\nIt is reasonably possible that the August 31, 2019 unrecognized tax benefits could decrease during the next\n\n12 months by $5.8 million, primarily related to a state settlement.\n\n', ""The components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in thousands):\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2019\n\n2018\n\nDeferred tax assets:\n\nCredits and net operating loss carryforward Accrued compensation Deferred revenues Stock-based compensation Property and equipment Purchased intangible assets Operating lease Other deferred tax assets\n\nTotal deferred tax assets Valuation allowance\n\n$\n\n107,163 $ 174 199 6,819 79 38 1,969 1,056 117,497 (107,161)\n\n100,326 240 246 6,811 391 — — 1,533 109,547 (95,301)\n\nDeferred tax liabilities:\n\nBasis difference on purchased intangible assets Operating lease Other deferred tax liabilities\n\nTotal deferred tax liabilities Net deferred tax liabilities\n\n$\n\n3,308 1,297 7,668 12,273 (1,937) $\n\n6,211 — 9,889 16,100 (1,854)\n\nOther deferred tax assets and liabilities are primarily comprised of the tax effects of accounts receivable reserves, sales allowances, deferred\n\nrent, and other miscellaneous accruals. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $117.5 million and $109.6 million, respectively. The Company also had deferred tax liabilities of $12.3 million and $16.1 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income, if any, the amount and timing of which is uncertain. Based on the available objective evidence, and historical operating performance, management believes that it is more likely than not that all U.S. and certain foreign deferred tax assets are not realizable. Accordingly, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset with a valuation allowance. The net valuation allowance increased by approximately $11.9 million and $10.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $285.9 million which will begin to expire in the year 2020. The Company had state net and foreign operating loss carryforwards of approximately $268.1 million and $24.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has research credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $16.0 million which will begin to expire in the year 2032. The Company also had state net research credit carryforwards for income tax purposes of approximately $18.3 million which can be carried forward indefinitely. The Company also had MAT credit carry forwards for Indian income tax purposes of approximately $0.7 million which will begin to expire in the year 2030.\n\nA reconciliation of the gross unrecognized tax benefit is as follows (in thousands):\n\n2019\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018\n\n2017\n\nUnrecognized tax benefit - beginning balance Increases for tax positions taken in prior years Decreases for tax positions taken in prior years Increases for tax positions taken in current year Unrecognized tax benefit - ending balance\n\n$\n\n$\n\n8,217 $ — — 623 8,840 $\n\n7,527 $ — (242) 932 8,217 $\n\n6,447 16 — 1,064 7,527\n\nThe unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would not impact the Company's effective tax rate as the recognition of these tax benefits would\n\nbe offset by changes in the Company's valuation allowance. The Company does not believe there will be any material changes in its unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months.\n\n93\n\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Due to the\n\nCompany’s historical loss position, all tax years from inception through December 31, 2019 remain open due to unutilized net operating losses.\n\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States and various states and foreign jurisdictions and is subject to examination by various taxing authorities including major jurisdiction like the United States.

These renewal terms can extend the lease term up to 6 years, and are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. Effective January 1, 2019, these operating leases are included as right-of- use assets in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, as a result of the adoption of the new leasing standard as discussed under Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, and represent the Company’s right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The present value of the Company’s obligation to make lease payments are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nBased on the present value of the lease payments for the remaining lease term of the Company's existing leases, the Company recognized 1) right-of-use assets of $8.5 million, adjusted for deferred rent and lease incentives as of the adoption date, and 2) lease liabilities for operating leases of $11.5 million on January 1, 2019.""]","As of August 31, 2019, the net operating loss carry forward was $57,299 (in thousands) for domestic state and $565,609 (in thousands) for foreign.","$183,297",,0.9999999999,0.99999999995,,0.955673100205544

An important element of our international strategy is to develop\n\ncontent that is specifically directed toward local cultures and customs. Net revenues from international sales accounted for approximately 54%, 54%, and 55% of our total consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The majority of our net revenues from foreign countries are generated by consumers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business, including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changes in local economies. Accordingly, our future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in local economies.\n\nOperating Metrics\n\nThe following operating metrics are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business.

Net bookings is the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period, and includes license fees, merchandise, and publisher incentives, among others.

Credit Facility\n\nIn November 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the ‘‘2016 Credit Facility’’) with Silicon Valley Bank (‘‘SVB’’) as the lender. The 2016 Credit Facility provided a three-year, $25.0 million revolving credit facility, which included a maximum of $25.0 million letter of credit subfacility. Loan advances under the revolving facility were available of up to the full $25.0 million when the balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities minus outstanding revolving loans and letters of credit equaled or exceeded $50.0 million. If our net cash fell below $50.0 million, loan advances were determined based on a borrowing base equal to a specified percentage of the value of our eligible accounts receivable. Loans bore interest, at our option, at (i) the prime rate reported in The Wall Street Journal, minus 0.50% or (ii) a LIBOR rate determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility, plus 2.50%. Over the term of the 2016 Credit Facility, we paid customary closing fees, commitment fees and letter of credit fees for a facility of this size and type.\n\nIn September 2018, we entered into an amendment with SVB to reduce the unused revolving credit facility fee\n\non the 2016 Credit Facility from 0.4% to 0.3%.\n\nOur obligations under the 2016 Credit Facility were secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property. The 2016 Credit Facility required us to maintain compliance with customary affirmative and negative covenants, including compliance with an adjusted quick ratio of not less than 1.50:1.00, as determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility and restricted our ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions on our capital stock.\n\nOn November 1, 2019, the maturity date, we elected to allow the 2016 Credit Facility to expire without renewal. There were no outstanding loans or advances as of the maturity date. We currently have no plans for entering into a new borrowing facility.\n\n', ' 2019 ANNUAL REPORT MD&A 35', 'April 26, 2019 $\n\nApril 28, 2017\n\n348 $ 11 26 (35 ) (54 ) 296 $\n\n218 $ 131 — (1 ) — 348 $\n\n216 7 7 — (12 ) 218\n\n$\n\nAs of April 26, 2019, we had $296 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $252 million has been recorded in other long-term liabilities.

In constant currency, our total applications revenues and our total infrastructure revenues each grew during fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 as customers continued to deploy our applications technologies and infrastructure technologies through different deployment models that we offer that enable customer choice. The Americas region contributed 43%, the EMEA region contributed 31% and the Asia Pacific region contributed 26% of the constant currency revenues growth for this business in fiscal 2019.\n\nIn constant currency, total cloud and license expenses increased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 due to higher sales and marketing expenses and higher cloud services and license support expenses, each of which increased primarily due to higher employee related expenses from higher headcount and due to higher technology infrastructure expenses.\n\nExcluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license segment’s total margin increased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to increased revenues, while total margin as a percentage of revenues decreased slightly due to expenses growth.\n\n48\n\n2018\n\n18,030 9,163 4,848 32,041\n\n3,441 7,213 10,654 21,387\n\n67%\n\n56% 29% 15%\n\n26,269 5,772 32,041\n\n', 'Revenue by geographic area are as follows (in thousands):\n\nUnited States Europe, Middle East and Africa South America Canada Asia and Pacific Rim All other\n\nYear Ended February 28, 2018 $ 268,453 $ 265,613 $ 259,974 49,918 17,738 8,412 8,967 6,093 $ 363,800 $ 365,912 $ 351,102\n\n2019\n\n2017\n\n49,496 15,134 9,815 13,958 6,944\n\n45,830 20,699 14,958 12,873 5,939\n\nRevenues by geographic area are based upon the country of billing.

Additionally, the balance excludes contractual obligations recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as current liabilities.\n\nOperating Leases\n\nWe lease most of our administrative, R&D, and manufacturing facilities; regional sales/service offices; and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Certain of our facility leases for buildings located in Fremont and Livermore, California; Tualatin, Oregon; and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. In addition to amounts included in the table above, we have guaranteed residual values for certain of our Fremont and Livermore facility leases of up to $250 million.

In accordance with SAB 118, we finalized the amount of the transition tax during the period ended December 23, 2018. The final amount is $868.4 million.

We pay cash interest on the 2041 Notes at an annual rate of 2.625%, on a semi-annual basis. The 2041 Notes may be converted, under certain circumstances, into our Common Stock.\n\nDuring the quarter-ended June 30, 2019, the market value of our Common Stock was greater than or equal to 130% of the 2041 Notes conversion prices for 20 or more trading days of the 30 consecutive trading days preceding the quarter end.

How many shares PSUs granted in February 2016?,"['Stock Awards\n\nWe have granted RSUs to our employees, consultants and members of our Board of Directors, and PSUs to\n\ncertain executives.\n\nIn February 2016, we granted 547,000 PSUs with certain financial and operational targets. Actual performance, as measured at the time and prior to the restatement of the 2016 financial statements, resulted in participants achieving 80% of target. Given the PSUs did not contain explicit or implicit claw back rights, there was no change to stock-based compensation expense for the impact of the previously disclosed restatement of the 2016 consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2019, 253,203 shares had vested, 200,297 shares had been forfeited, and the remaining 93,500 shares will vest (as to 80%) in annual tranches through February 2020 subject to continued service vesting requirements.\n\nIn October 2018, we granted 464,888 PSUs with certain financial targets. These PSUs will become eligible to vest at 75% upon the achievement of the performance targets by December 31, 2020, and are subject to service condition vesting requirements. The remaining 25% of these PSUs will become eligible to vest on the first anniversary of the initial vesting date. None of these PSUs were vested as of December 31, 2019.\n\nIn April 2019, we granted 346,453 PSUs with certain financial targets. These PSUs will become eligible to vest at 75% on the second month following achievement of certain performance targets by December 31, 2021, with the remaining 25% of the PSUs to vest on the first anniversary of the initial vesting date, subject to continued service vesting requirements. None of these PSUs were vested as of December 31, 2019.\n\nIn December 2019, we granted 375,000 PSUs with certain market performance-based targets to be achieved between December 2019 and December 2023. One-third of each tranche of these PSUs will become eligible to vest on each of the three anniversaries of the date the performance-based target is achieved, subject to continued service vesting requirements. The grant date fair values of each tranche of these PSUs were estimated to be $4.59, $4.06 and $3.59 and determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model with the following assumptions: expected term of 4.0 years, expected volatility of 38.45%, risk-free interest rate of 1.7% and expected dividend yield of 0.0%.

Diluted net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period plus potential dilutive common shares, including stock options, RSUs and employee stock purchase rights, unless the potential common shares are anti-dilutive. Since we had net losses in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, none of the potential dilutive common shares were included in the computation of diluted shares for these periods, as inclusion of such shares would have been anti-dilutive.\n\n', ' and Subsidiaries 2019 Annual Report 57', '7%']","In February 2016, 547,000 PSUs were granted.","547,000",1.0,0.9999999999,0.9999999999,1.0,0.9688857931579918

Under these interest rate swap\n\ncontracts, the Group agreed with the counterparties to exchange, at specified interval, the difference\n\nbetween fixed contract rates and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed\n\nnotional amounts. These interest rate swap contracts had the economic effect of converting borrowings\n\nfrom floating rates to fixed rates and were qualified for hedge accounting. Details of the Group’s\n\noutstanding interest rate swap contracts as at 31 December 2019 have been disclosed in Note 38.\n\nThe effects of the interest rate swaps on the Group’s financial position and performance are as follows:\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nRMB’Million\n\nRMB’Million\n\nInterest rate swaps\n\nCarrying amount (non-current (liabilities)/assets)\n\n(494)\n\n1,663\n\nNotional amount\n\n29,423\n\n77,630\n\nMaturity date\n\n30/7/2021~\n\n28/6/2019~\n\n11/4/2024\n\n8/12/2023\n\nHedge ratio\n\n1:1\n\n1:1\n\nChange in fair value of outstanding hedging instruments\n\n(2,139)\n\n181\n\nsince 1 January\n\nChange in value of hedged item used to determine hedge\n\n(2,139)\n\n181\n\neffectiveness\n\nWeighted average hedged rate for the year\n\n2.10%\n\n1.60%\n\n179\n\n3\n\nFINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n3.1 Financial risk factors (continued)\n\n(a) Market risk (continued)\n\n(iii)\n\nInterest rate risk (continued)\n\nSwaps currently in place cover majority of the floating-rate borrowing and notes payable principal\n\noutstanding.\n\nAs at 31 December 2019 and 2018, management considered that any reasonable changes in the\n\ninterest rates would not result in a significant change in the Group’s results as the Group’s exposure to\n\ncash flow interest-rate risk arising from its borrowings and notes payable carried at floating rates after\n\nconsidering the effect of hedging is considered to be insignificant. Accordingly, no sensitivity analysis is\n\npresented for interest rate risk.\n\n(b) Credit risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to credit risk in relation to its cash and deposits placed with banks and financial\n\ninstitutions, accounts receivable, other receivables, as well as short-term investments measured at amortised\n\ncost, at FVOCI and at FVPL. The carrying amount of each class of these financial assets represents the\n\nGroup’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to the corresponding class of financial assets.\n\nThe majority of the balances of accounts receivable are due from advertising customers and agencies,\n\ncontent production related customers, FinTech and cloud customers and third party platform providers. To\n\nmanage the risk arising from accounts receivable, the Group has policies in place to ensure that revenues\n\nof credit terms are made to counterparties with an appropriate credit history and the management performs\n\nongoing credit evaluations of its counterparties. The credit periods granted to these customers are disclosed\n\nin Note 30 and the credit quality of these customers are assessed, which takes into account their financial\n\nposition, past experience and other factors. The Group has a large number of customers and there is no\n\nconcentration of credit risk.\n\nOther receivables are mainly comprised of loans to investees and investees’ shareholders, rental deposits\n\nand other receivables.

Interest income increased due to higher interest rates. Other expense in the year ended December 31, 2018, was driven by foreign currency translation losses mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro. Other income in the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven mainly by foreign currency translation gains due to the depreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro.\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nEffective tax rate\n\n19.9%\n\nThe effective income tax rate in 2018 was 19.9% compared to 64.1% in the prior year. The tax rate in 2018 was favorably impacted by a discrete one-time rate change benefit related to the Tax Act resulting from the election of tax accounting method changes, partially offset by a one-time withholding tax on repatriation of earnings from one of our foreign subsidiaries that was completed during the year to enable the use of tax credits due to expire in 2018. The tax rate in 2017 was unfavorably impacted by the application of the Tax Act, driven by the remeasurement of the net deferred tax assets from 35% to 21% and the one-time mandatory transition tax on the historical earnings of foreign affiliates, which resulted in a net non-cash charge of $18,001.\n\nNet earnings were $46,532 or $1.39 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to earnings of $14,448 or $0.43 per diluted share in the comparable period of 2017.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $100,241 at December 31, 2019, and $100,933 at December 31, 2018, of which $98,309 and $96,762, respectively, were held outside the United States. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $692 was primarily driven by cash generated from operating activities of $64,405 and net proceeds from an increase in borrowings of long-term debt of $49,700, which were offset by the payment for the QTI acquisition of $73,906, capital expenditures of $21,733, treasury stock purchases of $11,746, dividends paid of $5,238, and taxes paid on behalf of equity award participants of $2,657. Total debt as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, was $99,700 and $50,000, respectively. Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, defined as long-term debt as a percentage of total debt and shareholders’ equity, was 19.7% at December 31, 2019, compared to 11.7% at December 31, 2018.\n\nWorking capital increased by $5,164 from December 31, 2018, to December 31, 2019, driven mainly by the decrease in accrued payroll and benefits due to lower short-term incentive compensation and the decrease in accounts payable, which were partially offset by an increase in operating lease obligations.\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $64,405 during the year ended December 31, 2019. Components of net cash provided by operating activities included net earnings of $36,146, depreciation and amortization expense of $24,619, stock-based compensation of $5,015, other net non-cash items totaling $5,160, and a net cash outflow from changes in assets and liabilities of $6,535.\n\nCTS CORPORATION 21\n\n(3,343)\n\n1,284\n\n3,817\n\n1,758\n\n64.', ""Table of Contents\n\nDifferences between income taxes calculated using the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, 26.9% in the fiscalyear ended July 31, 2018, and 35% in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017 and the provision for income taxes are as follows (in thousands): Fiscal years ended July 31, 2019 2018 2017Statutory federal income tax$2,617 $(2,224) $9,984State taxes, net of federal benefit(939) (993) 806Share-based compensation(8,013) (8,715) 2,517Non-deductible officers' compensation3,938 3,230 959Foreign income taxed at different rates203 1,022 (819)Research tax credits(6,943) (5,822) (2,377)Re-measurement of U.S. deferred taxes— 36,125 —Non-deductible acquisition costs— 1,270 270Domestic production activity deduction— — (1,370)Permanent differences and others918 666 484Change in valuation allowance(61) (6,092) —Total provision for (benefit from) income taxes$(8,280) $18,467 $10,454The tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in thousands): As of July 31, 2019 2018Accruals and reserves$7,870 $12,129Stock-based compensation6,353 7,658Deferred revenue2,316 4,023Property and equipment— 1,268Net operating loss carryforwards55,881 56,668Tax credits74,819 60,450Total deferred tax assets147,239 142,196Less valuation allowance31,421 28,541Net deferred tax assets115,818 113,655Less deferred tax liabilities: Intangible assets7,413 11,461Convertible debt10,274 11,567Property and equipment1,435 —Unremitted foreign earnings302 258Capitalized commissions6,086 —Total deferred tax liabilities25,510 23,286Deferred tax assets, net90,308 90,369Less foreign deferred revenue— 69Less foreign capitalized commissions906 —Total net deferred tax assets89,402 90,300The Company considered both positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxableincome, tax planning strategies, historic book profit/loss, prior taxable income/loss, and results of future operations, and determined that a valuation allowance wasnot required for a significant portion of its deferred tax assets.

The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $692 was primarily driven by cash generated from operating activities of $64,405 and net proceeds from an increase in borrowings of long-term debt of $49,700, which were offset by the payment for the QTI acquisition of $73,906, capital expenditures of $21,733, treasury stock purchases of $11,746, dividends paid of $5,238, and taxes paid on behalf of equity award participants of $2,657. Total debt as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, was $99,700 and $50,000, respectively. Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, defined as long-term debt as a percentage of total debt and shareholders’ equity, was 19.7% at December 31, 2019, compared to 11.7% at December 31, 2018.\n\nWorking capital increased by $5,164 from December 31, 2018, to December 31, 2019, driven mainly by the decrease in accrued payroll and benefits due to lower short-term incentive compensation and the decrease in accounts payable, which were partially offset by an increase in operating lease obligations.\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $64,405 during the year ended December 31, 2019. Components of net cash provided by operating activities included net earnings of $36,146, depreciation and amortization expense of $24,619, stock-based compensation of $5,015, other net non-cash items totaling $5,160, and a net cash outflow from changes in assets and liabilities of $6,535.\n\nCTS CORPORATION 21\n\n(3,343)\n\n1,284\n\n3,817\n\n1,758\n\n64.']",The net income in 2018 was $57.2 million.,"254,127",0.0,0.0,0.0,,1.0

Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, consisting of net loss of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $26.2 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $16.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $10.0 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an outflow from the changes in accrued liabilities and other of $5.9 million and inventory of $5.6 million, partially offset by an inflow from changes in deferred revenue of $3.2 million.\n\nThe unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and other was driven by an increase in lease liabilities associated with the lease of the San Jose corporate office. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to build up of inventory and timing of shipments, partially offset by increased reserves. The favorable change in deferred revenues was primarily driven by increased bookings.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million, consisting of net loss of $27.6 million which includes payments for our internal investigation costs of $8.6 million, non-cash charges of $25.0 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.9 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $3.1 million, offset primarily by an outflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $6.1 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and inventory of $1.5 million.\n\nThe favorable change in deferred revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the sale of subscription and support. The favorable change in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, increased value added tax accrual due to timing of payments, and an increase in legal fees accrual. The unfavorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections. The unfavorable change in prepaid and other assets was mainly driven by the increase in deferred sales commissions due to higher deferred revenue and higher average commission rate. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to the timing of shipments.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $14.3 million, consisting of a net loss of $10.8 million, a cash decrease resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million and non-cash charges of $26.4 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $17.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance of $1.1 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $12.4 million and deferred revenue of $3.0 million, and an outflow from the change in accrued liabilities of $8.9 million, inventory of $4.7 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and accounts payable of $0.9 million.\n\n', 'Table of Contents\n\nItem 6.

Credit Facility\n\nIn November 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the ‘‘2016 Credit Facility’’) with Silicon Valley Bank (‘‘SVB’’) as the lender. The 2016 Credit Facility provided a three-year, $25.0 million revolving credit facility, which included a maximum of $25.0 million letter of credit subfacility. Loan advances under the revolving facility were available of up to the full $25.0 million when the balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities minus outstanding revolving loans and letters of credit equaled or exceeded $50.0 million. If our net cash fell below $50.0 million, loan advances were determined based on a borrowing base equal to a specified percentage of the value of our eligible accounts receivable. Loans bore interest, at our option, at (i) the prime rate reported in The Wall Street Journal, minus 0.50% or (ii) a LIBOR rate determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility, plus 2.50%. Over the term of the 2016 Credit Facility, we paid customary closing fees, commitment fees and letter of credit fees for a facility of this size and type.\n\nIn September 2018, we entered into an amendment with SVB to reduce the unused revolving credit facility fee\n\non the 2016 Credit Facility from 0.4% to 0.3%.\n\nOur obligations under the 2016 Credit Facility were secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property. The 2016 Credit Facility required us to maintain compliance with customary affirmative and negative covenants, including compliance with an adjusted quick ratio of not less than 1.50:1.00, as determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility and restricted our ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions on our capital stock.\n\nOn November 1, 2019, the maturity date, we elected to allow the 2016 Credit Facility to expire without renewal. There were no outstanding loans or advances as of the maturity date. We currently have no plans for entering into a new borrowing facility.\n\n', ' 2019 ANNUAL REPORT MD&A 35']","The company's 2019 right of use assets amounted to $33,014,000.","$33,014",1.0,0.49999999995,0.49999999995,1.0,0.9538892934301998

Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, consisting of net loss of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $26.2 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $16.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $10.0 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an outflow from the changes in accrued liabilities and other of $5.9 million and inventory of $5.6 million, partially offset by an inflow from changes in deferred revenue of $3.2 million.\n\nThe unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and other was driven by an increase in lease liabilities associated with the lease of the San Jose corporate office. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to build up of inventory and timing of shipments, partially offset by increased reserves. The favorable change in deferred revenues was primarily driven by increased bookings.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million, consisting of net loss of $27.6 million which includes payments for our internal investigation costs of $8.6 million, non-cash charges of $25.0 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.9 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $3.1 million, offset primarily by an outflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $6.1 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and inventory of $1.5 million.\n\nThe favorable change in deferred revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the sale of subscription and support. The favorable change in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, increased value added tax accrual due to timing of payments, and an increase in legal fees accrual. The unfavorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections. The unfavorable change in prepaid and other assets was mainly driven by the increase in deferred sales commissions due to higher deferred revenue and higher average commission rate. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to the timing of shipments.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $14.3 million, consisting of a net loss of $10.8 million, a cash decrease resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million and non-cash charges of $26.4 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $17.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance of $1.1 million.

The cases were consolidated into In re: Processed Egg Products Antitrust Litigation, No. 2:08-md-02002-GP, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the “District Court”), in three groups of cases - the “Direct Purchaser Putative Class Action”, the “Indirect Purchaser Putative Class Action” and the “Non-Class Cases.”\n\nThe Direct Purchaser Putative Class Action. The named plaintiffs in these cases alleged that they purchased eggs or egg products directly from a defendant and sued on behalf of themselves and a putative class of others who claimed to be similarly situated. As previously reported, in November 2014, the District Court approved the Company’s settlement with the direct purchaser plaintiff class and entered final judgment dismissing with prejudice the class members’ claims against the Company.\n\nThe Indirect Purchaser Putative Class Action. The named plaintiffs in these cases are individuals or companies who allege that they purchased shell eggs indirectly from one or more of the defendants - that is, they purchased from retailers that had previously purchased from defendants or other parties - and sued on behalf of themselves and a putative class of others who claim to be similarly situated. The District Court denied the indirect purchaser plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. On June 28, 2018, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the indirect purchaser plaintiffs, for an immaterial amount, and on July 17, 2018, the Court entered an order dismissing all indirect purchaser plaintiffs’ claims against the Company and other defendants.\n\nThe Non-Class Cases. In the remaining cases, the named plaintiffs allege that they purchased shell eggs and egg products directly from one or more of the defendants but sue only for their own alleged damages and not on behalf of a putative class. On April 4, 2018, the Court entered a final judgement dismissing all claims against the Company brought by the following non-class plaintiffs: The Kroger Co.; Publix Super Markets, Inc.; SUPERVALU, Inc.; Safeway, Inc.; Albertsons LLC; H.E. Butt Grocery Co.; The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, Inc.; Walgreen Co.; Hy- Vee, Inc.; and Giant Eagle, Inc., with prejudice, pursuant to the Company’s previously announced $80.8 million settlement with the named plaintiffs.\n\nThe Company settled all Non-Class cases except for the claims of certain plaintiffs who sought substantial damages allegedly arising from the purchase of egg products (as opposed to shell eggs). As previously reported, the Company settled all claims brought by one of these plaintiffs, Conopco, Inc. on a confidential basis and for an amount that did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or results, and on November 21, 2018, the Court entered a final judgment dismissing Conopco’s claims against the Company. The remaining plaintiffs are Kraft Food Global, Inc., General Mills, Inc., Nestle USA, Inc., and The Kellogg Company (“Egg Products Plaintiffs”)."", ' In connection with the vesting and issuance of restricted stock-based awards and stock options that were exercised, the tax benefits realized by us were $692 million, $860 million and $614 million for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\n105\n\n2017\n\n4.8 1.0% 23% 1.5% 8.18\n\n2017\n\n54 11 44 306 770 130 35 1,350 (423) 927']","The company's effective tax rate in 2019 was impacted by the following:

If the oil field no longer produces oil or is abandoned or the contract term is not extended, we will no longer generate revenue under the related contract and will need to seek to redeploy affected vessels. FPSO contracts under which our FPSO units operate are subject to extensions beyond their initial term. The likelihood of these contracts being extended may be negatively affected by reductions in oil field reserves, low oil prices generally or other factors. If we are unable to promptly redeploy any affected vessels at rates at least equal to those under the contracts, if at all, our operating results will be harmed. Any potential redeployment may not be under long-term contracts, which may affect the stability of our cash flow and our ability to make cash distributions. FPSO units, in particular, are specialized vessels that have very limited alternative uses and high fixed costs. In addition, FPSO units typically require substantial capital investments prior to being redeployed to a new field and production service agreement. Any idle time prior to the commencement of a new contract or our inability to redeploy the vessels at acceptable rates may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\n\nWe do not control access to cash flow generated by our investments in equity-accounted joint ventures. We do not have control over the operations of, nor do we have any legal claim to the revenue and expenses of our investments in, our equity-accounted joint ventures.

What does Adjusted gross margin represent?,"['equity-based compensation; (4) adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments or receipts that may represent a reduction or increase in cash available to us; and (5) other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces the usefulness of the metric as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA alongside our other GAAP-based financial performance measures, net loss and our other GAAP financial results. The following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\n2019\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018\n\nNet loss Interest and investment (income) expense, net Provision for income taxes Depreciation and amortization Loss on extinguishment of convertible notes Stock-based compensation Adjusted EBITDA\n\n$\n\n$\n\n(52,250) $ 2,979 425 19,671 1,406 33,489 5,720\n\n$\n\n(47,515) $ 4,504 796 13,693 —\n\n25,825 (2,697)\n\n$\n\n\n\nAdjusted Gross Margin. Adjusted gross margin represents gross profit plus amortization of acquired intangibles and stock-based compensation. Adjusted gross margin is a measure used by management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to generate future operating plans. The exclusion of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis. In the near term, we expect these expenses to continue to negatively impact our gross profit. Adjusted gross margin is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that adjusted gross margin provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Nevertheless, our use of adjusted gross margin has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. You should consider adjusted gross margin alongside our other GAAP-based financial performance measures, gross profit and our other GAAP financial results.

Volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was flat in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior-year period. This result reflected merchandising changes and price elasticity-related declines in certain brands, as well as isolated production challenges, partially offset by the continued benefit from momentum and innovation successes in the snacks businesses. Price/ mix was flat compared to the prior year as unfavorable mix, coupled with increases in brand building investments with retailers were offset by the impact of higher pricing. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC, which was completed in October 2017, contributed $41.3 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 results included $115.9 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.

Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 1% increase in volume compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales volumes was a result of innovation across multiple brands, which was partially offset by the effects of reduced merchandising spend and the impact of a recall during the fourth quarter. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2018, as continued delivery of top-line accretive innovation in several brands was partially offset by brand building investments with retailers. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business, which was completed in February 2018, contributed $25.7 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition.\n\nInternational net sales for fiscal 2019 were $793.4 million, a decrease of $50.1 million, or 6%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 2% increase in volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, a 4% decrease due to foreign exchange rates, and a 2% increase in price/mix, in each case compared to fiscal 2018. The volume and price/ mix increases for fiscal 2019 were driven by growth in the Canadian snacks and frozen businesses. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $3.7 million to International net sales for fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 included $4.1 million of net sales related to our Del Monte® processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada, which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $48.9 million of net sales related to this divested business. In addition, fiscal 2019 and 2018 results included $17.1 million and $24.5 million, respectively, related to our divested Wesson® oil business.\n\nFoodservice net sales for fiscal 2019 were $934.2 million, a decrease of $120.6 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 14% decrease in volume, excluding divestitures. The decline in volume reflected the continued execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy and the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Price/mix increased 5% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in price/mix for fiscal 2019 reflected favorable product and customer mix, the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing, and the execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy. Fiscal 2019 included $34.2 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $53.4 million of net sales related to this divested business. Net sales declined by approximately 7% in fiscal 2019 due to the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility.\n\nPinnacle Foods net sales for fiscal 2019 (reflecting 213 days of Conagra Brands ownership) were $1.73 billion. Results reflected expected consumption declines as the Company executes its value-over-volume strategy within the Pinnacle portfolio.\n\n26\n\n% Inc (Dec)\n\n— %\n\n2 %\n\n(6)%\n\n(11)%\n\n100 %\n\n"", 'Supplementary Financial Data (Unaudited) (in millions, except per-share amounts)\n\nQuarters Ended Revenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Gross margin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Operating income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income per share - basic . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income per share - diluted . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Cash dividends declared per common share. . . . . . . . . . . $ Cash and cash equivalents and investments . . . . . . . . . . . $\n\nJuly 27, 2019 (1) April 27, 2019\n\n13,428 $ 8,574 $ 3,690 $ 2,206 $ 0.52 $ 0.51 $ 0.35 $ 33,413 $\n\n12,958 $ 8,173 $ 3,513 $ 3,044 $ 0.70 $ 0.69 $ 0.35 $ 34,643 $\n\nJanuary 26, 2019 12,446 7,773 3,211 2,822 0.63 0.63 0.33 40,383\n\nOctober 27, 2018 13,072 $ 8,146 $ 3,805 $ 3,549 $ 0.78 $ 0.77 $ 0.33 $ 42,593 $\n\nQuarters Ended Revenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Gross margin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Operating income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income (loss) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income (loss) per share - basic . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income (loss) per share - diluted. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Cash dividends declared per common share . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Cash and cash equivalents and investments . . . . . . . . . . . . . $\n\nJuly 28, 2018 (2)\n\n12,844 $ 7,922 $ 3,346 $ 3,803 $ 0.81 $ 0.81 $ 0.33 $ 46,548 $\n\nApril 28, 2018\n\n12,463 $ 7,759 $ 3,134 $ 2,691 $ 0.56 $ 0.56 $ 0.33 $ 54,431 $\n\nJanuary 27, 2018 (3) October 28, 2017 12,136 $ 11,887 7,427 $ 7,498 2,756 3,073 $ 2,394 (8,778) $ 0.48 (1.78) $ 0.48 (1.78) $ 0.29 $ 0.29 71,588 $ 73,683\n\n(1) In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we recorded an $872 million charge which was the reversal of the previously recorded benefit associated with the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends recorded in fiscal 2018 as a result of a retroactive final U.S. Treasury regulation issued during the quarter.\n\n(2) In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded adjustments to the provisional amounts related to the U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and re-measurement of net deferred tax assets. These adjustments included an $863 million benefit to the U.S. transition tax provisional amount related to the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends in the transition fiscal year.\n\n(3) In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a provisional tax expense of $11.1 billion related to the Tax Act, comprised of $9.0 billion of U.S. transition tax, $1.2 billion of foreign withholding tax, and $0.9 billion re-measurement of net DTA.\n\nItem 9.\n\nChanges in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures\n\nNone.\n\nItem 9A.\n\nControls and Procedures\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nBased on our management’s evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act”)) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nManagement’s report on our internal control over financial reporting and the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our internal control over financial reporting are set forth, respectively, on page 57 under the caption “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting” and on page 55 of this report.\n\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n', '$800.0 million, cash dividends paid of $342.3 million, repayments of long-term debt of $242.3 million, and a net increase in short-term borrowings of $249.1 million.\n\nThe Company had cash and cash equivalents of $236.6 million at May 26, 2019 and $128.0 million at May 27, 2018, of which $144.8 million at May 26, 2019, and $121.6 million at May 27, 2018, was held in foreign countries. We believe that our foreign subsidiaries have invested or will invest any undistributed earnings indefinitely, or that any undistributed earnings will be remitted in a tax-neutral transaction, and, therefore, do not provide deferred taxes on the cumulative undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.\n\nOur preliminary estimate of capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 is approximately $400 million.\n\nManagement believes that existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, existing credit facilities, and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our repayment of debt, including any repayment of debt or refinancing of debt, working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months.\n\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\n\nWe use off-balance sheet arrangements (e.g., leases accounted for as operating leases) where sound business principles warrant their use. We also periodically enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. These are described further in ""Obligations and Commitments"" below.\n\nVariable Interest Entities Not Consolidated\n\nWe lease or leased certain office buildings from entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities. The lease agreements with these entities include fixed-price purchase options for the assets being leased. The lease agreements also contain contingent put options (the ""lease put options"") that allow or allowed the lessors to require us to purchase the buildings at the greater of original construction cost, or fair market value, without a lease agreement in place (the ""put price"") in certain limited circumstances. As a result of substantial impairment charges related to our divested Private Brands operations, these lease put options became exercisable. We are amortizing the difference between the put price and the estimated fair value (without a lease agreement in place) of the property over the remaining lease term within SG&A expenses. During fiscal 2018, we purchased two buildings that were subject to lease put options and recognized net losses totaling $48.2 million for the early exit of unfavorable lease contracts. During fiscal 2017, one of these lease agreements expired, and we reversed the applicable accrual and recognized a benefit of $6.7 million in SG&A expenses.\n\nAs of May 26, 2019 and May 27, 2018, there was one remaining leased building subject to a lease put option for which the put option price exceeded the estimated fair value of the property by $8.2 million, of which we had accrued $1.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively. This lease is accounted for as an operating lease, and accordingly, there are no material assets and liabilities, other than the accrued portion of the put price, associated with this entity included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of this entity. In making this determination, we have considered, among other items, the terms of the lease agreement, the expected remaining useful life of the asset leased, and the capital structure of the lessor entity.\n\nOBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS\n\nAs part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements, debt agreements, and unconditional purchase obligations (i.e., obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices, such as ""take-or-pay"" contracts). The unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in our normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available. Of these items, debt, notes payable, and capital lease obligations, which totaled $10.72 billion as of May 26, 2019, were recognized as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations, which totaled $1.75 billion as of May 26, 2019, were not recognized as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\n37\n\nA summary of our contractual obligations as of May 26, 2019, was as follows:\n\nPayments Due by Period (in millions)\n\nContractual Obligations Long-term debt . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Capital lease obligations . . . . . . . . . .\n\nTotal\n\n10,556.6\n\n165.4\n\n$\n\nLess than 1 Year\n\n— $\n\n20.6\n\n1-3 Years\n\n2,747.6\n\n41.0\n\n$\n\n3-5 Years\n\n2,287.0\n\n29.4\n\n$\n\nAfter 5 Years\n\n5,522.0\n\n74.4\n\nOperating lease obligations . . . . . . . .

Such agreements are generally settleable in the ordinary course of business in less than one year.\n\nWe are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our long-term debt and capital lease obligations. The weighted-\n\naverage coupon interest rate of the long-term debt obligations outstanding as of May 26, 2019, was approximately 4.7%.\n\nAs of May 26, 2019, we had aggregate unfunded pension and postretirement benefit obligations totaling $131.7 million and $87.8 million, respectively. These amounts are not included in the table above as the unfunded obligations are remeasured each fiscal year, thereby resulting in our inability to accurately predict the ultimate amount and timing of any future required contributions to such plans. Based on current statutory requirements, we are not obligated to fund any amount to our qualified pension plans during the next twelve months. We estimate that we will make payments of approximately $14.2 million and $10.8 million over the next twelve months to fund our pension and postretirement plans, respectively.']",The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business contributed $25.7 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2019.,$25.7 million,1.0,0.9999999999,0.9999999999,,0.9763097721432327

Credit Facility\n\nIn November 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the ‘‘2016 Credit Facility’’) with Silicon Valley Bank (‘‘SVB’’) as the lender. The 2016 Credit Facility provided a three-year, $25.0 million revolving credit facility, which included a maximum of $25.0 million letter of credit subfacility. Loan advances under the revolving facility were available of up to the full $25.0 million when the balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities minus outstanding revolving loans and letters of credit equaled or exceeded $50.0 million. If our net cash fell below $50.0 million, loan advances were determined based on a borrowing base equal to a specified percentage of the value of our eligible accounts receivable. Loans bore interest, at our option, at (i) the prime rate reported in The Wall Street Journal, minus 0.50% or (ii) a LIBOR rate determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility, plus 2.50%. Over the term of the 2016 Credit Facility, we paid customary closing fees, commitment fees and letter of credit fees for a facility of this size and type.\n\nIn September 2018, we entered into an amendment with SVB to reduce the unused revolving credit facility fee\n\non the 2016 Credit Facility from 0.4% to 0.3%.\n\nOur obligations under the 2016 Credit Facility were secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property. The 2016 Credit Facility required us to maintain compliance with customary affirmative and negative covenants, including compliance with an adjusted quick ratio of not less than 1.50:1.00, as determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility and restricted our ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions on our capital stock.\n\nOn November 1, 2019, the maturity date, we elected to allow the 2016 Credit Facility to expire without renewal. There were no outstanding loans or advances as of the maturity date. We currently have no plans for entering into a new borrowing facility.\n\n', 'Statements of Cash Flows\n\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow related activities (in thousands):\n\nYears Ended December 31, 2018\n\n2019\n\n2017\n\nCash (used in) provided by:\n\nOperating activities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, consisting of net loss of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $26.2 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $16.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $10.0 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an outflow from the changes in accrued liabilities and other of $5.9 million and inventory of $5.6 million, partially offset by an inflow from changes in deferred revenue of $3.2 million.\n\nThe unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and other was driven by an increase in lease liabilities associated with the lease of the San Jose corporate office. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to build up of inventory and timing of shipments, partially offset by increased reserves. The favorable change in deferred revenues was primarily driven by increased bookings.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million, consisting of net loss of $27.6 million which includes payments for our internal investigation costs of $8.6 million, non-cash charges of $25.0 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.9 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $3.1 million, offset primarily by an outflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $6.1 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and inventory of $1.5 million.\n\nThe favorable change in deferred revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the sale of subscription and support. The favorable change in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, increased value added tax accrual due to timing of payments, and an increase in legal fees accrual. The unfavorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections. The unfavorable change in prepaid and other assets was mainly driven by the increase in deferred sales commissions due to higher deferred revenue and higher average commission rate. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to the timing of shipments.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $14.3 million, consisting of a net loss of $10.8 million, a cash decrease resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million and non-cash charges of $26.4 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $17.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance of $1.1 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $12.4 million and deferred revenue of $3.0 million, and an outflow from the change in accrued liabilities of $8.9 million, inventory of $4.7 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and accounts payable of $0.9 million.\n\n']",The depreciation expense from continuing operations in 2019 was $10.0 million and in 2018 was $7.9 million.,"$12,548, $12,643",0.0,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,,0.9787783576695169

What does working capital consist of?,"[' Capital spending at Bell Wireless was', 'operations and our ability to manage costs and working capital successfully. Additionally, our cash flow generation ability is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs. Further, our capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned if, for example, our revenues do not reach expected levels, or we have to incur unforeseen capital expenditures and make investments to maintain our competitive position. If this is the case, we may seek alternative financing, such as selling additional debt or equity securities, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on favorable terms, if at all. Moreover, if we issue new debt securities, the debt holders would have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. If we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities, existing stockholders may experience dilution, and such new securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms and conditions of additional financings unattractive. Our inability to raise capital could impede our growth or otherwise require us to forego growth opportunities and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our working capital:\n\nFor the Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n(Dollars in thousands)\n\nCash and cash equivalents Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts Inventories, net Prepaid expenses Other current assets Accounts payable Accrued expenses Current operating lease liabilities Total Working Capital\n\n9,472 18,581 12,542 3,276 10,453 (18,668) (22,133) (1,185) 12,338 $\n\n$\n\nWorking Capital consists of current assets net of current liabilities. Working capital decreased $0.4 million to $12.3 million at December 31, 2019 compared with $12.7 million at December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily a result of an increase of cash, accounts receivable, and inventory offset by an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and current operating lease liabilities.\n\nWe normally carry three to four weeks of finished goods inventory. The average duration of our accounts receivable is approximately 25 days.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 our capital resources consisted of primarily $9.5 million cash on hand and $33.0 million available under our credit facilities, net of $2.0 million reserved for two letters of credit. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our capital resources consisted primarily of $7.5 million cash on hand and $30.0 million available under our credit facilities. The Credit Facilities will mature in May 2024.\n\nWe borrowed $72.3 million under our credit facilities during 2019, of which $18.5 million was repaid prior to the end of the year. As of December 31, 2019, we had $54.5 million of debt outstanding (including $0.7 million of debt issuance costs) under our credit facilities.

We believe our capital expenditures, excluding cash paid for acquisitions, for fiscal 2020 will be approximately $38.0 million to $42.0 million. The increase in projected capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 is the result of planned expansions of several of our distribution facilities. Our planned capital projects will provide both new and expanded facilities and improvements to our technology that we believe will produce increased efficiency and the capacity to continue to support the growth of our customer base.\n\nCash Flows\n\nFiscal Year Ended\n\nDecember 27, 2019\n\nDecember 28, 2018\n\nDecember 29, 2017\n\nNet income\n\n$\n\n24,193 $\n\n20,402 $\n\n14,366\n\nNon-cash charges\n\n$\n\n47,625 $\n\n38,186 $\n\n28,725\n\nChanges in working capital\n\n$\n\n(26,811) $\n\n(13,506) $\n\n(11,594)\n\nCash provided by operating activities\n\n$\n\n45,007 $\n\n45,082 $\n\n31,497\n\nCash used in investing activities\n\n$\n\n(44,154) $\n\n(33,688) $\n\n(42,406)\n\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities\n\n$\n\n96,947 $\n\n(10,442) $\n\n19,429\n\nFiscal Year 2019 Cash Flows\n\nNet cash provided by operations was $45.0 million for fiscal 2019 consisting of $24.2 million of net income and $47.6 million of non-cash charges, partially offset by an increase in working capital of $26.8 million. The increase in non-cash charges of $9.4 million is primarily driven by changes in the fair value of earn-out liabilities of $4.4 million and higher depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in working capital of $26.8 million is a result of organic growth and acquisitions and includes $1.8 million of earn-out liability payments classified as operating activities.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $44.2 million in fiscal 2019 driven by $16.1 million in capital expenditures which included implementations of our Enterprise Resource Planning system and the buildouts of our headquarters in Ridgefield, CT and distribution center in Dallas, Texas. The Company used $28.1 million in cash to fund acquisitions, the most significant of which was Bassian.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $96.9 million for fiscal 2019 driven by $145.0 million of net proceeds received from the issuance of our Senior Notes, partially offset by $44.2 million to settle all borrowings outstanding on our ABL and $2.4 million of earn-out liability payments classified as financing activities.\n\n']",Working capital consists of current assets net of current liabilities.,current assets less current liabilities.,1.0,0.5833333333041666,0.5833333333041666,1.0,0.9999999999999996

The net increase in the total valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 is primarily related to the increase of a net operating loss carry forward due to a release of a non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefit and the increase of deferred tax assets in sites with existing valuation allowances. The decrease in domestic federal and state tax credits is primarily related to the utilization of tax credits against the one-time transition tax.\n\nAs of August 31, 2019, the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the remaining earnings from its foreign\n\nsubsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not already been recorded. The accumulated earnings are the most significant component of the basis difference which is indefinitely reinvested.', 'Deferred income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheets result from temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting and tax purposes.

As a result of the Act, we recognized an estimated expense of $11.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, of which $9.2 million related to the write- down of deferred tax assets and $2.7 million related to tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings. We calculated our best estimate of the impact of the Act in our 2017 year-end income tax provision in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which was issued to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed to finalize the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act. Additional work to complete a more detailed analysis of historical foreign earnings, as well as the full impact relating to the write-down of deferred tax assets, was completed in the third quarter of 2018 and resulted in a tax benefit of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, non-current deferred taxes related to our investments and our defined benefit pension plan reflect deferred taxes on the net unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments and deferred taxes on unrealized losses in our pension plan.

What is Audit Fees?,"['ITEM NO. 2 – RATIFICATION OF KPMG AS OUR 2020 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR\n\nTHE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THIS PROPOSAL\n\nThe Audit Committee of the Board has appointed KPMG LLP as our independent auditor for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020, and we are submitting that appointment to our shareholders for ratification on an advisory basis at the meeting. Although shareholder ratification of KPMG’s appointment is not legally required, we are submitting this matter to the shareholders, as in the past, as a matter of good corporate practice. In determining whether to reappoint KPMG as our independent auditor, the Audit Committee considered a number of factors, including, among others, the firm’s qualifications, industry expertise, prior performance, control procedures, proposed staffing and the reasonableness of its fees on an absolute basis and as compared with fees paid by comparable companies.\n\nIf the shareholders fail to vote on an advisory basis in favor of the appointment, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether to retain KPMG, and may appoint that firm or another without resubmitting the matter to the shareholders. Even if the shareholders ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee may, in its discretion, select a different independent auditor at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the Company’s best interests.\n\nIn connection with the audit of the 2019 financial statements, we entered into an engagement letter with KPMG which sets forth the terms by which KPMG will provide audit services to us. Any future disputes between KPMG and us under that letter will be subject to certain specified alternative dispute resolution procedures, none of which are intended to restrict the remedies that our shareholders might independently pursue against KPMG.\n\nThe following table lists the aggregate fees and costs billed to us by KPMG and its affiliates for the 2018 and 2019 services identified below:\n\nAmount Billed\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nAudit Fees(1)\n\n$16,014,014 $17,639,702\n\nAudit-Related Fees(2)\n\n106,528\n\n153,203\n\nTax Fees(3)\n\n1,318,798\n\n119,098\n\nOther\n\n—\n\n—\n\nTotal Fees\n\n$17,439,340 $17,912,003\n\n(1)\n\nIncludes the cost of services rendered in connection with (i) auditing our annual consolidated financial statements, (ii) auditing our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (iii) reviewing our quarterly financial statements, (iv) auditing the financial statements of several of our subsidiaries, (v) reviewing our registration statements and issuing related comfort letters, (vi) statutory audits for certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and (vii) consultations regarding accounting standards.

Credit Facility\n\nIn November 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the ‘‘2016 Credit Facility’’) with Silicon Valley Bank (‘‘SVB’’) as the lender. The 2016 Credit Facility provided a three-year, $25.0 million revolving credit facility, which included a maximum of $25.0 million letter of credit subfacility. Loan advances under the revolving facility were available of up to the full $25.0 million when the balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities minus outstanding revolving loans and letters of credit equaled or exceeded $50.0 million. If our net cash fell below $50.0 million, loan advances were determined based on a borrowing base equal to a specified percentage of the value of our eligible accounts receivable. Loans bore interest, at our option, at (i) the prime rate reported in The Wall Street Journal, minus 0.50% or (ii) a LIBOR rate determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility, plus 2.50%. Over the term of the 2016 Credit Facility, we paid customary closing fees, commitment fees and letter of credit fees for a facility of this size and type.\n\nIn September 2018, we entered into an amendment with SVB to reduce the unused revolving credit facility fee\n\non the 2016 Credit Facility from 0.4% to 0.3%.\n\nOur obligations under the 2016 Credit Facility were secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property. The 2016 Credit Facility required us to maintain compliance with customary affirmative and negative covenants, including compliance with an adjusted quick ratio of not less than 1.50:1.00, as determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility and restricted our ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions on our capital stock.\n\nOn November 1, 2019, the maturity date, we elected to allow the 2016 Credit Facility to expire without renewal. There were no outstanding loans or advances as of the maturity date. We currently have no plans for entering into a new borrowing facility.\n\n', 'Table of Contents\n\nItem 6.
