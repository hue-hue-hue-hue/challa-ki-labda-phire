Annualized cost savings related to actions initiated in fiscal 2019 are expected to be approximately $220 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2021. Cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses.\n\nIn response to market weakness in fiscal 2019, we initiated incremental restructuring actions, primarily consisting of employee severance, to broaden the scope of our cost reduction initiatives and accelerate cost reduction and factory footprint consolidation activities. We previously disclosed that we expected total restructuring charges to be approximately $375 million in fiscal 2019. We now expect certain of these actions to occur in fiscal 2020 or 2021. For fiscal 2020, we currently expect total restructuring charges to be approximately $200 million to $250 million and total spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to be approximately $300 million.\n\nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other\n\ncharges.\n\nOperating Income\n\nThe following table presents operating income and operating margin information:\n\nFiscal\n\nOperating income\n\n2019\n\n$ 1,978\n\n2018 ($ in millions) $ 2,331\n\nChange\n\n$ (353)\n\nOperating margin\n\n14.7 % 16.7 %\n\nOperating income included the following:\n\nFiscal\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n(in millions)\n\nAcquisition-related charges:\n\nAcquisition and integration costs Charges associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments\n\nRestructuring and other charges, net Other items(1) Total\n\n$\n\n27 $\n\n14\n\n8 22 126 — $ 302 $ 148\n\n3 30 255 17\n\n(1)\n\nRepresents the write-off of certain spare parts.\n\nSee discussion of operating income below under “Segment Results.”\n\n14', 'TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nNet sales by segment and industry end market(1) were as follows:\n\n2019\n\nFiscal 2018 (in millions)\n\n2017\n\nTransportation Solutions:\n\nAutomotive Commercial transportation Sensors\n\nTotal Transportation Solutions\n\n$ 5,686 $ 6,092 $ 5,228 997 1,280 814 918 7,039 8,290\n\n1,221 914 7,821\n\nIndustrial Solutions:\n\nIndustrial equipment Aerospace, defense, oil, and gas Energy\n\nTotal Industrial Solutions\n\n1,949 1,306 699 3,954\n\n1,987 1,157 712 3,856\n\n1,747 1,075 685 3,507\n\nCommunications Solutions:\n\nData and devices Appliances\n\nTotal Communications Solutions\n\nTotal\n\n963 676 1,639 $ 13,448 $ 13,988 $ 12,185\n\n993 680 1,673\n\n1,068 774 1,842\n\n(1)\n\nIndustry end market information is presented consistently with our internal management reporting and may be revised periodically as management deems necessary.\n\nNet sales by geographic region and segment were as follows:\n\n2019\n\nFiscal 2018 (in millions)\n\n2017\n\nEurope/Middle East/Africa (“EMEA”):\n\nTransportation Solutions Industrial Solutions Communications Solutions\n\nTotal EMEA\n\n$ 3,099 $ 3,417 $ 2,786 1,354 1,534 259 304 4,399 5,255\n\n1,466 258 4,823\n\nAsia–Pacific:\n\nTransportation Solutions Industrial Solutions Communications Solutions Total Asia–Pacific\n\n2,812 625 964 4,401\n\n3,025 668 1,069 4,762\n\n2,715 634 963 4,312\n\nAmericas:\n\nTransportation Solutions Industrial Solutions Communications Solutions\n\nTotal Americas\n\nTotal\n\n1,538 1,519 417 3,474 $ 13,448 $ 13,988 $ 12,185\n\n1,910 1,863 451 4,224\n\n1,848 1,654 469 3,971\n\nOperating income by segment was as follows:\n\nTransportation Solutions Industrial Solutions Communications Solutions\n\nTotal\n\nFiscal 2018 (in millions) $ 1,226 $ 1,578 $ 1,294 364 218 $ 1,978 $ 2,331 $ 1,876\n\n2019\n\n2017\n\n543 209\n\n465 288\n\n75']",Operating income in the Transportation Solutions segment decreased by $352 million in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018.,decreased $352 million,1.0,0.9999999999666667,0.9999999999666667,1.0,0.9755685231440978

The increase was primarily attributable to a $11.8 million increase in payroll and related expenses, primarily consisting of salaries and incentive-based compensation, a $8.7 million increase in ERP integration and technology transition costs, a $4.0 million increase in rent and software costs, and a $2.8 million increase in consulting expenses. Additionally, $2.5 million of the overall increase was attributed to 19 additional days of ownership of our TOKIN subsidiary during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.

This decrease was due to a $5.2 million decrease in products revenue, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in services revenue. The decrease in products revenue was primarily driven by lower demand from our service provider customers in the Americas. Revenues from service provider customers decreased 10% in 2018 compared to 2017. Revenue from enterprise customers remained relatively constant in 2018 compared to 2017.\n\nProducts revenue decreased $5.2 million, or 3%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by lower demand from our service provider customers in the Americas, as well as decreases from EMEA, offset in part by a $2.6 million increase from the adoption of ASC 606 in 2018 and by the increase in products revenue primarily from Japan and Asia Pacific. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information related to our adoption of ASC 606.\n\nServices revenue increased $2.0 million, or 2%, in 2018 compared to 2017.

The decrease was primarily due to lower products revenue driven by lower demand from our service providers in the Americas.\n\nDuring 2018, $55.2 million, or 24%, of total revenue was generated from Japan, which represents a 7% increase in revenue compared to 2017. The increase was mainly due to higher product revenues driven by higher demand from our service providers in Japan.\n\nDuring 2018, $36.9 million, or 16%, of total revenue was generated from the Asia Pacific regions excluding Japan, which represents a 11% increase compared to 2017. The increase was driven primarily by higher products revenue as well as higher services revenue from PCS sales in connection with our increased installed customer base.\n\nDuring 2018, $27.6 million, or 12%, of total revenue was generated from EMEA, which remained relatively\n\nconsistent from 2017.\n\nCost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\n\nCost of revenue\n\nCost of products revenue is primarily comprised of cost of third-party manufacturing services and cost of inventory for the hardware component of our products. Cost of products revenue also includes warehouse personnel costs, shipping costs, inventory write-downs, certain allocated facilities and information technology infrastructure costs, and expenses associated with logistics and quality control.\n\nCost of services revenue is primarily comprised of personnel costs for our technical support, training and professional service teams.

What does the recorded investment include?,"['At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our restricted investments consisted of long-term marketable securities that were also held in custodial accounts to fund the estimated future costs of collecting and recycling modules covered under our solar module collection and recycling program. As necessary, we fund any incremental amounts for our estimated collection and recycling obligations on an annual basis based on the estimated costs of collecting and recycling covered modules, estimated rates of return on our restricted investments, and an estimated solar module life of 25 years less amounts already funded in prior years. To ensure that amounts previously funded will be available in the future regardless of potential adverse changes in our financial condition (even in the case of our own insolvency), we have established a trust under which estimated funds are put into custodial accounts with an established and reputable bank, for which First Solar, Inc.; First Solar Malaysia Sdn. Bhd.; and First Solar Manufacturing GmbH are grantors. Trust funds may be disbursed for qualified module collection and recycling costs (including capital and facility related recycling costs), payments to customers for assuming collection and recycling obligations, and reimbursements of any overfunded amounts. Investments in the trust must meet certain investment quality criteria comparable to highly rated government or agency bonds.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold certain restricted investments for proceeds of $281.6 million and realized gains of $40.6 million on such sales as part of efforts to align the currencies of the investments with those of the corresponding collection and recycling liabilities and disburse $22.2 million of overfunded amounts. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold certain restricted investments for proceeds of $231.1 million and realized gains of $55.4 million on such sales as part of an effort to align the currencies of the investments with those corresponding collection and recycling liabilities and disburse $143.1 million of overfunded amounts.

What is the Group's assumptions on mortality?,"['Risks associated with the scheme The Scheme exposes the Company to some risks, the most significant of which are:\n\nAsset volatility\n\nThe liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields. If assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The Scheme holds a significant proportion of growth assets (equities, diversified growth fund and global absolute return fund) which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term. The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Scheme’s long-term objectives.\n\nInflation risk\n\nA proportion of the Scheme’s benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation leads to higher liabilities (although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation). The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.\n\nChange in bond yields\n\nA decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the Scheme’s liabilities for accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Scheme’s bond holdings.\n\nLife expectancy\n\nThe majority of the Scheme’s obligations are to provide benefits for the lifetime of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.\n\nFunding requirements UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently. The ongoing funding valuation of the Scheme was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 30 April 2018 and showed a deficit of £0.2m. The Company paid deficit contributions of £70,000 for the year ending 31 March 2019 (2018: £70,000), and has committed to contribute £140,000 per annum from 1 April 2019, which is expected to make good this shortfall by 31 March 2020. The next funding valuation is due no later than 30 April 2021, at which progress towards full-funding will be reviewed. The Company also pays expenses and PPF levies incurred by the Scheme.\n\nAssumptions used The last triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme was performed by an independent professional actuary at 30 April 2018 using the projected unit method of valuation. For the purposes of IAS 19 (revised) the actuarial valuation as at 30 April 2018 has been updated on an approximate basis to 31 March 2019. There have been no changes in the valuation methodology adopted for this year’s disclosures compared to the prior year’s disclosures.\n\nThe principal financial assumptions used to calculate the liabilities under IAS 19 (revised) are as follows:\n\n2019 %\n\n2018 %\n\nDiscount rate for scheme liabilities\n\n2.45\n\n2.60\n\nCPI inflation\n\n2.35\n\n2.25\n\nRPI inflation\n\n3.45\n\n3.35\n\nPension increases\n\nPre 1988 GMP\n\n–\n\n–\n\nPost 1988 GMP\n\n2.10\n\n2.10\n\nPre 2004 non GMP\n\n5.00\n\n5.00\n\nPost 2004\n\n3.35\n\n3.25\n\nThe financial assumptions reflect the nature and term of the Scheme’s liabilities.\n\nThe Group has assumed that mortality will be in line with nationally published mortality table S2NA with CMI 2018 projections related to members’ years of birth with long-term rate of improvement of 1.5% per annum. These tables translate into an average life expectancy for a pensioner retiring at age 65 as follows:\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nMen Years\n\nWomen Years\n\nMen Years\n\nWomen Years\n\nMember aged 65 (current life expectancy)\n\n86.8\n\n88.9\n\n87.3\n\n89.3\n\nMember aged 45 (life expectancy at age 65)\n\n88.5\n\n90.7\n\n89.0\n\n91.1\n\nIt is assumed that 50% of non-retired members of the Scheme will commute the maximum amount of cash at retirement (2018: 50% of non-retired members of the Scheme will commute the maximum amount of cash at retirement).\n\n', 'Table of Contents\n\nAssumptions:\n\nThe following table provides the weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine the actuarial present value of\n\nprojected benefit obligations at:\n\nDomestic September 30,\n\nInternational September 30,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nDiscount rate: Expected return on plan assets: Rate of compensation increase:\n\n3.00 %\n\n4.00 %\n\n1.90 % 3.40 % — %\n\n2.90 % 3.80 % — %\n\nThe following table provides the weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost\n\nfor years ended:\n\nDomestic September 30,\n\nInternational September 30,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nDiscount rate: Expected return on plan assets: Rate of compensation increase:\n\n4.00 %\n\n3.75 %\n\n1.90 % 3.40 % — %\n\n2.80 % 3.70 % — %\n\nFor domestic plans, the discount rate was determined by comparison against the FTSE pension liability index for AA rated corporate instruments. The Company monitors other indices to assure that the pension obligations are fairly reported on a consistent basis.

The net increase in the total valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 is primarily related to the increase of a net operating loss carry forward due to a release of a non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefit and the increase of deferred tax assets in sites with existing valuation allowances. The decrease in domestic federal and state tax credits is primarily related to the utilization of tax credits against the one-time transition tax.\n\nAs of August 31, 2019, the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the remaining earnings from its foreign\n\nsubsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not already been recorded.

All of the NOL carryforward was incurred subsequent to the enactment of the TCJA and therefore has an indefinite carryforward period. The Company has significant deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to property, plant and equipment, which are expected to reverse and allow for the full utilization of the NOL carryforward. As such, the Company has not recorded a valuation allowance related to the NOL carryforward. Also included in the deferred tax assets are North Carolina Investing in Business Property Credit and North Carolina Jobs Credits totaling $4.9 million, as well as Georgia Job Tax Credits totaling $2.6 million. The North Carolina Investing in Business Property Credit provides a 7% investment tax credit for property located in a North Carolina development area, the North Carolina Creating Jobs Credit provides a tax credit for increased employment in North Carolina, and the Georgia Job Tax Credit provides a tax credit for creation and retention of qualifying jobs in Georgia. It is management’s opinion that the majority of the North Carolina and Georgia income tax credits will not be utilized before they expire, and a $5.6 million valuation allowance has been recorded as of October 31, 2019. The North Carolina credits began to expire during fiscal 2018, and the remaining credits expire between fiscal years 2020 and 2023.\n\n58\n\n2017\n\n117,611 11,024 128,635\n\n15,452 1,804 (1,106) 16,150 144,785\n\n2018\n\n88,351 1,751 90,102\n\n7,814 2,862 8,280 12,235 654 (11,017) 6,481 27,309 62,793"", 'Deferred income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheets result from temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting and tax purposes.

Additional work to complete a more detailed analysis of historical foreign earnings, as well as the full impact relating to the write-down of deferred tax assets, was completed in the third quarter of 2018 and resulted in a tax benefit of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, non-current deferred taxes related to our investments and our defined benefit pension plan reflect deferred taxes on the net unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments and deferred taxes on unrealized losses in our pension plan. The net change in non-current deferred taxes associated with these items, which resulted in a deferred tax benefit of $0.4 million and $2.8 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, was recorded as an adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss), presented in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\n\n2018\n\n$6,609\n\n2,850\n\n1,122\n\n4,779\n\n3,069\n\n326\n\n5,538\n\n3,097\n\n8,164\n\n17,495\n\n—\n\n—\n\n(5,816)\n\n47,233\n\n(3,515)\n\n(6,531)\n\n—\n\n—\n\n(10,046)\n\n$37,187\n\nFinancial Results 71']",The increase in the Company's deferred tax liability is primarily attributable to the Company's decision to take bonus depreciation on qualifying assets placed in service during fiscal 2019.,the Company's decision to take bonus depreciation on qualifying assets placed in service during fiscal 2019.,1.0,0.9999999999666667,0.9999999999666667,1.0,0.9855751273693724
What is the company's main cost of revenue?,"['Table of Contents\n\nrevenue consists of personnel costs for our technical support team. Our cost of services revenue primarily consists of personnel costs for our professional serviceemployees, third-party contractors, and travel-related costs. In instances where we have primary responsibility for the delivery of services, subcontractor fees areexpensed as cost of services revenue. In each case, personnel costs include salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation.We allocate overhead such as information technology support, information security, facilities, and other administrative costs to all functional departmentsbased on headcount.

Cloud infrastructure costs include $9.5million of hosting related costs that were recorded in cost of services revenue in fiscal year 2018. The treatment of these hosting related costs is consistent with thetreatment of the related revenue in each fiscal year.We anticipate higher cost of license and subscription revenue as we continue to invest in our cloud operations to increase operational efficiency and scalewhile growing our customer base.Cost of maintenance revenue increased by $1.7 million primarily due to the increase in personnel required to support our term and perpetual licensecustomers.Our cost of services revenue would have increased if cloud infrastructure costs totaling $9.5 million were not reclassified to cost of license and subscriptionrevenue, consistent with the treatment of the related revenue.

This decrease was due to a $5.2 million decrease in products revenue, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in services revenue. The decrease in products revenue was primarily driven by lower demand from our service provider customers in the Americas. Revenues from service provider customers decreased 10% in 2018 compared to 2017. Revenue from enterprise customers remained relatively constant in 2018 compared to 2017.\n\nProducts revenue decreased $5.2 million, or 3%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by lower demand from our service provider customers in the Americas, as well as decreases from EMEA, offset in part by a $2.6 million increase from the adoption of ASC 606 in 2018 and by the increase in products revenue primarily from Japan and Asia Pacific. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information related to our adoption of ASC 606.\n\nServices revenue increased $2.0 million, or 2%, in 2018 compared to 2017.

Since these are short-term highly liquid investments with remaining\n\nmaturities of 3 months or less, they present negligible risk of changes in fair value due to changes in interest rates and are Level 1.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n\nOur foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency options, interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps are recorded at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets using a discounted cash flow analysis that incorporates observable market inputs. These market inputs include foreign currency spot and forward rates, and various interest rate curves, and are obtained from pricing data quoted by various banks, third-party sources and foreign currency dealers involving identical or comparable instruments and are Level 2.\n\nCounterparties to these foreign currency forward contracts have at least an investment grade rating. Credit ratings on\n\nsome of our counterparties may change during the term of our financial instruments. We closely monitor our counterparties’ credit ratings and, if necessary, will make any appropriate changes to our financial instruments. The fair value generally reflects the estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date.\n\nForeign currency forward contracts and options are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other\n\ncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\nOther Financial Instruments\n\nThe following financial instruments are recorded at fair value or at amounts that approximate fair value: (1) trade receivables, net, (2) certain other current assets, (3) accounts payable and (4) other current liabilities. The carrying amounts reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the above financial instruments closely approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.\n\nOther liabilities that are recorded at carrying value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets include our credit facilities and\n\nsenior notes. We utilize a market approach to calculate the fair value of our senior notes. Due to their limited investor base and the face value of some of our senior notes, they may not be actively traded on the date we calculate their fair value. Therefore, we may utilize prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving similar securities, reflecting U.S. Treasury yields to calculate the yield to maturity and the price on some of our senior notes. These inputs are provided by an independent third party and are considered to be Level 2 inputs.\n\nWe derive our fair value estimates of our various other debt instruments by evaluating the nature and terms of each instrument, considering prevailing economic and market conditions, and examining the cost of similar debt offered at the balance sheet date. We also incorporated our credit default swap rates and currency specific swap rates in the valuation of each debt instrument, as applicable.\n\nThese estimates are subjective and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment, and therefore we cannot\n\ndetermine them with precision.

Included among our non-financial assets and liabilities that are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis are inventories, net property and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets and asset retirement obligations.\n\nCredit and Market Risk\n\nFinancial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest or currency exchange rates. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, establishing credit limits, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk.\n\nWe do not expect any of our counterparties in derivative transactions to fail to perform as it is our policy to have counterparties to these contracts that have at least an investment grade rating. Nevertheless, there is a risk that our exposure to losses arising out of derivative contracts could be material if the counterparties to these agreements fail to perform their obligations. We will replace counterparties if a credit downgrade is deemed to increase our risk to unacceptable levels.\n\nWe regularly monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments.\n\nWe continually monitor the creditworthiness of our diverse base of customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business and generally do not require collateral. We consider the concentrations of credit risk associated with our trade accounts receivable to be commercially reasonable and believe that such concentrations do not leave us vulnerable to significant risks of near-term severe adverse impacts. The terms and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. Our sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers.\n\n', 'Disclosures related to periods prior to adoption of ASC 842Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $4.7 million and $5.2 million, respectively, recognized on a straight-line basis for theCompany’s facility leases which were accounted for as operating leases.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTThe Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is determined based upon the exit price that would be received to sellan asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, as determined by either the principal market or the most advantageousmarket. Inputs used in the valuation techniques to derive fair values are classified based on a three-level hierarchy, as follows:Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2—Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets with insufficient volumeor infrequent transactions (less active markets), or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from orcorroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3—Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities.The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company’sinvestments are in money market funds, U.S. treasury bonds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, asset-backed securities and corporate debt securities, whichare classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, and were initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued at each reporting date utilizingmarket-observable data.

What happens if the shareholders fail to vote on an advisory basis in favor of the appointment?,"['ITEM NO. 2 – RATIFICATION OF KPMG AS OUR 2020 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR\n\nTHE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THIS PROPOSAL\n\nThe Audit Committee of the Board has appointed KPMG LLP as our independent auditor for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020, and we are submitting that appointment to our shareholders for ratification on an advisory basis at the meeting. Although shareholder ratification of KPMG’s appointment is not legally required, we are submitting this matter to the shareholders, as in the past, as a matter of good corporate practice. In determining whether to reappoint KPMG as our independent auditor, the Audit Committee considered a number of factors, including, among others, the firm’s qualifications, industry expertise, prior performance, control procedures, proposed staffing and the reasonableness of its fees on an absolute basis and as compared with fees paid by comparable companies.\n\nIf the shareholders fail to vote on an advisory basis in favor of the appointment, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether to retain KPMG, and may appoint that firm or another without resubmitting the matter to the shareholders. Even if the shareholders ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee may, in its discretion, select a different independent auditor at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the Company’s best interests.\n\nIn connection with the audit of the 2019 financial statements, we entered into an engagement letter with KPMG which sets forth the terms by which KPMG will provide audit services to us. Any future disputes between KPMG and us under that letter will be subject to certain specified alternative dispute resolution procedures, none of which are intended to restrict the remedies that our shareholders might independently pursue against KPMG.\n\nThe following table lists the aggregate fees and costs billed to us by KPMG and its affiliates for the 2018 and 2019 services identified below:\n\nAmount Billed\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nAudit Fees(1)\n\n$16,014,014 $17,639,702\n\nAudit-Related Fees(2)\n\n106,528\n\n153,203\n\nTax Fees(3)\n\n1,318,798\n\n119,098\n\nOther\n\n—\n\n—\n\nTotal Fees\n\n$17,439,340 $17,912,003\n\n(1)\n\nIncludes the cost of services rendered in connection with (i) auditing our annual consolidated financial statements, (ii) auditing our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (iii) reviewing our quarterly financial statements, (iv) auditing the financial statements of several of our subsidiaries, (v) reviewing our registration statements and issuing related comfort letters, (vi) statutory audits for certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and (vii) consultations regarding accounting standards. In addition, the amount listed for 2018 includes a final billing of $785,000 that was received after we finalized our 2019 proxy statement and consequently was not reflected in the auditor fee table included in our 2019 proxy statement.\n\n(2)\n\nIncludes the cost of preparing agreed upon procedures reports and providing general accounting consulting services.\n\n(3)\n\nIncludes costs associated with general tax planning, consultation and compliance (which were approximately $1,300,000 in 2018 and approximately $100,000 in 2019).\n\nThe Audit Committee maintains written procedures that require it to annually review and pre-approve the scope of all services to be performed by our independent auditor. This review includes an evaluation of whether the provision of non-audit services by our independent auditor is compatible with maintaining the auditor’s\n\n', '28 | 2020 Proxy Statement', ""NOTE 3 - continued\n\nLong-term employee benefit obligations The obligation comprises an obligation under the incentive programs to deliver Restricted Share Units in TORM plc at a determinable price to the entity's key personnel.

Commissioner upheld U.S. Treasury Department regulations requiring that related parties in a cost-sharing arrangement share expenses related to stock-based compensation in proportion to the economic activity of the parties. The ruling reversed the prior decision of the U.S. Tax Court. On November 12, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the plaintiff’s request for an en banc rehearing. Based on the appellate court’s ruling, the Company recorded a cumulative income tax expense of $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.

The Company evaluated its ability to realize the benefit of its net deferred tax assets and weighed all available positive and negative evidence both objective and subjective in nature. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the weight given to positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. Consideration was given to negative evidence such as: the duration and severity of losses in prior years, high seasonal revenue concentrations, increasing competitive pressures, and a challenging retail environment. Realization of the Company’s net deferred tax assets is dependent upon its generation of sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income change.\n\nThe Company recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the net amount that the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has a valuation allowance of $191.7 million against its U.S. deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance of $52.9 million against certain of its foreign deferred tax assets that the Company is not expected to realize.

The certificates of deposit are not debt securities.\n\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents and trade receivables. The Company currently invests its excess cash in government and prime money market funds. The cash in the Company’s U.S. banks is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to the insurable limit of $250,000.\n\nIncome (Loss) per Share\n\nThe computation of basic net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share includes the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares had been issued. In periods with a net loss, all common stock equivalents are excluded from the per share calculation; therefore, the basic loss per share equals the diluted loss per share.\n\nInventories and Inventory Valuation\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market value. Market value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by estimated costs of disposal. Should actual market conditions differ from the Company’s estimates, the Company’s future results of operations could be materially affected. Reductions in inventory valuation are included in Cost of revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company reviews inventory for excess quantities and obsolescence based on its best estimates of future demand, product lifecycle status and product development plans. The Company uses historical information along with these future estimates to reduce the inventory cost basis. Subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. Prices anticipated for future inventory demand are compared to current and committed inventory values.\n\nThe components of inventories are as follows:\n\nMarch 31,\n\n(in thousands) Raw materials\n\nFinished goods\n\n$\n\n2019\n\n3,445 $ 6,356\n\nTotal inventories\n\n$\n\n9,801 $\n\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets\n\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets generally consist of prepaid product royalty, prepaid maintenance agreements and prepaid rent, which are amortized as expense generally over the term of the underlying contract or estimated product life.\n\nLand, Property and Equipment\n\nLand, property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or for leasehold improvements, the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives for machinery and equipment range from 5 to 7 years and for office, computer and research equipment from 2 to 5 years. Expenditures for major renewals and improvements that extend the useful life of property and equipment are capitalized.\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $0.6 million and $0.8 million for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. In accordance with ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment (ASC 360), the Company assesses all of its long-lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment when impairment indicators are identified. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss may be necessary. An impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset.\n\nThe Company acquired 16 acres of land with an acquisition and sold 4 acres in April 2015 for $264,000. The Company still owns 12 acres of land that remains on the market. The Company concluded that a sale transaction for the remaining land is not probable within the next year; therefore, unsold land is classified as held-and-used as of March 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\n37-\n\n2018\n\n2,969 6,253\n\n9,222\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe components of fixed assets are as follows:\n\nMarch 31,\n\n(in thousands) Land\n\n$\n\n2019\n\n672 $\n\nMachinery and equipment Office, computer and research equipment Leasehold improvements\n\n1,372 5,267 798\n\nLand, property and equipment, gross\n\nLess accumulated depreciation and amortization\n\n$\n\n8,109 $ (6,811 )\n\nLand, property and equipment, net\n\n$\n\n1,298 $\n\nIntangible Assets\n\nIntangible assets with determinable lives are amortized on a straight-line basis or the consumption period based on expected cash flows from the underlying intangible asset over their respective estimated useful lives. If the Company were to determine that a change to the remaining estimated useful life of an intangible asset was necessary, then the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. On an ongoing basis, the Company reviews intangible assets with a definite life and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that carrying values may not be recoverable. If such events or changes in circumstances occur, the Company will recognize an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flow expected to be generated by the asset is less than the carrying value of the related asset. Any impairment loss would adjust the asset to its implied fair value.\n\nSee Note 4, Intangible Assets for further discussion of intangible assets impairment evaluations.\n\nAccrued Expenses\n\nThe components of accrued expenses are as follows:\n\nMarch 31,\n\n(in thousands) Accrued compensation\n\n$\n\n2019\n\n656 $\n\nAccrued contractual obligation Other accrued expenses\n\n1,445 1,466\n\nTotal accrued expenses\n\n$\n\n3,567 $\n\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\n\nThe Company records revenue based on a five-step model in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers (ASC 606). The Company's revenue is derived from the sale of products, software, and services identified in contracts. A contract exists when both parties have an approved agreement that creates enforceable rights and obligations, identifies performance obligations and payment terms and has commercial substance. The Company records revenue from these contracts when control of the products or services transfer to the customer. The amount of revenue to be recognized is based upon the consideration, including the impact of any variable consideration, that the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these products and services.\n\nThe majority of the Company’s revenue is recorded at a point in time from the sale of tangible products. Revenue is recorded when control of the products passes to the customer, dependent upon the terms of the underlying contract. For right-to-use software, revenue is recognized at the point in time the customer has the right to use and can substantially benefit from use of the software. Products regularly include warranties that include bug fixes, and minor updates so that the product continues to function as promised in a dynamic environment, and phone support. These standard warranties are assurance type warranties which do not offer any services beyond the assurance that the product will continue working as specified. Therefore, warranties are not considered separate performance obligations. Instead, the Company accrues the expected cost of warranty.

In accordance with ASC 842, the Company determined if an arrangement was a lease at inception based on whetherthere is an identified asset, whether the Company has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset and whether the Companyhas the right to direct the use of the asset. As of December 31, 2019, the Company only has operating leases and does not have any financing leases. Operatinglease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. Leaseexpense for minimum lease payments was recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. See Note 9 for further disclosures regarding the Company’soperating leases.Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”). ASU 2019-12 is intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes by, among other things, eliminating certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod taxallocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences.ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, the Company must apply certainaspects of this standard retrospectively for all periods presented while other aspects are applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effectadjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on itsconsolidated financial statements.In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments(“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 is intended to provide more decision-useful information about expected credit losses on financial instruments and othercommitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The main provisions include presenting financial assets measured at amortized costat the amount expected to be collected, which is net of an allowance for expected credit losses, and recording credit losses related to available-for-sale securitiesthrough an allowance for credit losses. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and must be appliedusing a modified retrospective approach with earlier adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company does not expect theadoption of this amendment to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.4. REVENUEThe Company adopted ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. The Company recognized the cumulative effect ofinitially applying ASC 606, which was immaterial, as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative prior period information isaccounted for in accordance with the previous revenue guidance, ASC 605, and has not been restated. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company recognizesrevenue under the core principle to depict the transfer of control to the Company’s customers in an amount reflecting the consideration the Company expects to beentitled. In order to achieve that core principle, the Company applies the following five step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify theperformance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5)recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.Revenue for product sales is recognized at the point in time when control transfers to the Company’s customers, which is generally when products areshipped from the Company’s manufacturing facilities or when delivered to the customer’s named location. When the Company performs shipping and handlingactivities after the transfer of control to the customer (e.g., when control transfers prior to delivery), they are considered to be fulfillment activities, andaccordingly, the costs are accrued for when the related revenue is recognized. Taxes collected on behalf of customers relating to product sales and remitted togovernmental authorities, principally sales taxes, are excluded from revenue.', 'Contingencies\n\nWe evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with\n\nthe authoritative guidance on contingencies. We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes from potential claims or proceedings, as well as potential ranges of probable losses, when the outcomes of the claims or proceedings are probable and reasonably estimable. A determination of the amount of an accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after the analysis of each separate matter. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, we base our estimates on the information available at the time of our assessment. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates.\n\nNote 2. Recent Accounting Standards\n\nRecently adopted authoritative guidance\n\nRevenue Recognition — Contracts with Customers. In May 2014, the FASB issued new authoritative guidance for revenue from contracts with customers. The standard’s core principle is that a company recognizes revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, companies are required to capitalize certain contract acquisition costs, including commissions paid, when contracts are signed. The asset recognized from capitalized incremental and recoverable acquisition costs is amortized on a straight-line basis consistent with the timing of transfer of the products or services to which the asset relates.\n\nAs a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance, our net revenue for fiscal\n\n2019 increased $47 million, and our operating expenses decreased $12 million. See Note 3 for additional information related to the impact of the new guidance on the timing and amounts of revenues recognized in fiscal 2019.\n\nThe effects of the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance on our March 29, 2019\n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:\n\n(In millions)\n\nAs Reported\n\nAs of March 29, 2019 Balances Without Adoption of New Standard\n\nEffect of Change\n\nAccounts receivable, net Other current assets (1) Other long-term assets (2) Total assets\n\n$ $ $ $\n\n708 435 1,262 15,938\n\n$ $ $ $\n\n657 421 1,213 15,824\n\n$ $ $ $\n\n51 14 49 114\n\nShort-term contract liabilities Other current liabilities Long-term contract liabilities Deferred income tax liabilities Total liabilities\n\n$ $ $ $ $\n\n2,320 533 736 577 10,200\n\n$ $ $ $ $\n\n2,437 494 837 526 10,328\n\n$ $ $ $ $\n\n(117) 39 (101) 51 (128)\n\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss Retained earnings Total stockholders’ equity\n\n$ $ $\n\n(7) $ $ $\n\n933 5,738\n\n(2) $ $ $\n\n686 5,496\n\n(5) 247 242\n\n(1)\n\nAs reported includes short-term deferred commissions of $92 million.

What is the amount of unrealized losses from restricted investments at the end of 2018?,"['At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our restricted investments consisted of long-term marketable securities that were also held in custodial accounts to fund the estimated future costs of collecting and recycling modules covered under our solar module collection and recycling program. As necessary, we fund any incremental amounts for our estimated collection and recycling obligations on an annual basis based on the estimated costs of collecting and recycling covered modules, estimated rates of return on our restricted investments, and an estimated solar module life of 25 years less amounts already funded in prior years. To ensure that amounts previously funded will be available in the future regardless of potential adverse changes in our financial condition (even in the case of our own insolvency), we have established a trust under which estimated funds are put into custodial accounts with an established and reputable bank, for which First Solar, Inc.; First Solar Malaysia Sdn. Bhd.; and First Solar Manufacturing GmbH are grantors. Trust funds may be disbursed for qualified module collection and recycling costs (including capital and facility related recycling costs), payments to customers for assuming collection and recycling obligations, and reimbursements of any overfunded amounts.

The investments of SGRE in fiscal 2019 focused on pro- duction equipment for new blade types and capacity expansion in its factories.

Sharp order growth in Asia, Australia included two large orders for offshore wind-farms in- cluding service in Taiwan totaling € 2.3 billion. SGRE also re- corded sharply higher orders in the Americas region, driven by several large orders in the onshore business mainly in the U. S. In contrast, orders came in substantially lower in the region Europe, C. I. S., Africa, Middle East which in the prior year had included an order for an offshore wind-farm, including service, in the U. K. worth € 1.3 billion. Revenue was up significantly year-over-year, with substantial growth in the offshore and service businesses and clear growth in the onshore business. On a geographic basis, revenue rose substantially in Europe, C. I. S., Africa, Middle East, while it declined clearly in the other two reporting regions. Adjusted EBITA was on the prior-year level as positive effects from productivity improvements and higher revenue were offset by price declines, a less favorable project mix and higher ex- penses for integration costs and capacity adjustments including severance. Severance charges were € 32 million in fiscal 2019 and € 77 million in fiscal 2018. SGRE’s order backlog was € 26 billion at end of the fiscal year, of which € 9 billion are expected to be con- verted into revenue in fiscal 2020.\n\nThese results were achieved in markets that grew substantially in fiscal 2019 in terms of installed capacity due to higher demand in both the onshore and offshore markets, with the latter grow- ing faster. Market volume in euros was subject to adverse price development. On a regional basis, growth in the onshore busi- ness was again driven primarily by China where the largest na- tional wind market in the world for onshore generation remains largely closed to foreign manufacturers, and secondarily by the U. S. In contrast, the onshore market in Germany declined signifi- cantly. In the offshore market, growth was driven by the U. K. and China. SGRE expects global onshore wind installations to grow\n\nCombined Management Report\n\nclearly in fiscal 2020, driven by growth in the U. S. and India. Global offshore wind power markets are expected to grow in fiscal 2020. The driver of this growth is China which offsets a slight decline in European markets. Market volume in euros is expected to be sub- ject to adverse price development in the offshore business, reflect- ing the trends discussed above, and currency translation effects.\n\nA.3.8 Financial Services\n\nFinancial Services supports its customers’ investments with leas- ing solutions and equipment, project and structured financing in the form of debt and equity investments.

While the equity business recorded higher results, the result from the debt business declined, amongst others due to higher credit hits. Total assets increased along with a growth in debt business and in part due to positive currency translation effects.\n\nFinancial Services is geared to Siemens’ industrial businesses and its markets. As such Financial Services is influenced by the busi- ness development of the markets served by our industrial busi- nesses, among other factors. Financial Services will continue to focus its business scope on areas of intense domain know-how.\n\nA.3.9 Portfolio Companies\n\n', 'At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our restricted investments consisted of long-term marketable securities that were also held in custodial accounts to fund the estimated future costs of collecting and recycling modules covered under our solar module collection and recycling program. As necessary, we fund any incremental amounts for our estimated collection and recycling obligations on an annual basis based on the estimated costs of collecting and recycling covered modules, estimated rates of return on our restricted investments, and an estimated solar module life of 25 years less amounts already funded in prior years. To ensure that amounts previously funded will be available in the future regardless of potential adverse changes in our financial condition (even in the case of our own insolvency), we have established a trust under which estimated funds are put into custodial accounts with an established and reputable bank, for which First Solar, Inc.; First Solar Malaysia Sdn. Bhd.; and First Solar Manufacturing GmbH are grantors. Trust funds may be disbursed for qualified module collection and recycling costs (including capital and facility related recycling costs), payments to customers for assuming collection and recycling obligations, and reimbursements of any overfunded amounts. Investments in the trust must meet certain investment quality criteria comparable to highly rated government or agency bonds.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold certain restricted investments for proceeds of $281.6 million and realized gains of $40.6 million on such sales as part of efforts to align the currencies of the investments with those of the corresponding collection and recycling liabilities and disburse $22.2 million of overfunded amounts. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold certain restricted investments for proceeds of $231.1 million and realized gains of $55.4 million on such sales as part of an effort to align the currencies of the investments with those corresponding collection and recycling liabilities and disburse $143.1 million of overfunded amounts.

As of December 31, 2018, we identified six restricted investments totaling $87.4 million that had been in a loss position for a period of time greater than 12 months with unrealized losses of $6.4 million. The unrealized losses were primarily due to increases in interest rates relative to rates at the time of purchase. Based on the underlying credit quality of the investments, we generally hold such securities until we recover our cost basis. Therefore, we did not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired.\n\n101\n\nFair Value\n\n126,066 97,719 223,785\n\nFair Value\n\n']",The investments disposed of during the year ended 31 December 2019 were mainly engaged in the provision of Internet-related services.,provision of Internet-related services,,0.9999999999,0.9999999999,1.0,0.9743582716299124
What financial items does operating free cash flow consist of?,"['Table of Contents\n\nFree Cash Flow (non-U.S. GAAP measure). We also present Free Cash Flow, which is a non-U.S. GAAP measure, defined as (i) net cash from operating activities plus (ii) net cash used in investing activities, excluding payment for purchases (and proceeds from the sale) of marketable securities, and net cash variation for joint ventures deconsolidation, which are considered as temporary financial investments. The result of this definition is ultimately net cash from operating activities plus payment for purchase and proceeds from sale of tangible, intangible and financial assets, proceeds received in the sale of businesses and cash paid for business acquisitions. We believe Free Cash Flow, a non-U.S. GAAP measure, provides useful information for investors and management because it measures our capacity to generate cash from our operating and investing activities to sustain our operations. Free Cash Flow is not a U.S. GAAP measure and does not represent total cash flow since it does not include the cash flows generated by or used in financing activities. Free Cash Flow reconciles with the total cash flow and the net cash increase (decrease) by including the payment for purchases (and proceeds from the sale) of marketable securities and net cash variation from joint ventures deconsolidation, the net cash from (used in) financing activities and the effect of changes in exchange rates. In addition, our definition of Free Cash Flow may differ from definitions used by other companies. Free Cash Flow is determined from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as follows:\n\n2019\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 (In millions)\n\n2017\n\nNet cash from operating activities Net cash used in investing activities Excluding: Payment for purchase and proceeds from sale of marketable securities, and net cash variation for joint ventures deconsolidation Payment for purchase and proceeds from sale of tangible and intangible assets, payment for business acquisitions(1) Free Cash Flow (non-U.S. GAAP measure)\n\n$\n\n$\n\n1,869 $ (1,172)\n\n(200)\n\n(1,372) 497 $\n\n1,845 $ (1,212)\n\n(100)\n\n(1,312) 533 $\n\n1,677 (1,468)\n\n99\n\n(1,369) 308\n\n(1)\n\nReflects the total of the following line items reconciled with our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows relating to the investing activities: Payment for purchase of tangible assets, Proceeds from sale of tangible assets, Payment for purchase of intangible assets, Payment for purchase of financial assets, Proceeds from sale of financial assets, Payment for disposal of equity investment, Proceeds received in sale of businesses, Payment for business acquisitions, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired.\n\nFree Cash Flow was positive $497 million in 2019, compared to positive $533 million and positive $308\n\nmillion in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\n59', 'operating activities\n\nCash, restricted cash and short-term marketable securities\n\nCommitted global credit facilities\n\n$14.8\n\n$ 9.0\n\n$15.3\n\n$15.2\n\n$12.2\n\n$15.3\n\n$16.7\n\n$12.8\n\n$15.3\n\nAfter closing the Red Hat transaction, Moody’s, as expected, downgraded IBM and IBM Credit LLC’s long-term debt rating from A1 to A2 and improved its outlook to stable. We deleveraged during the second half of 2019 and remain committed to a target leverage profile consistent with a mid to high single A credit rating within a couple of years.\n\nOn July 9, 2019, we closed the acquisition of Red Hat for cash consideration of $34.8 billion. The transaction was funded through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from debt issuances. In order to reduce this debt and return to target leverage ratios within a couple of years, we suspended our share repurchase program at the time of the Red Hat acquisition closing. In the second half of 2019, we reduced debt levels by $10.1 billion. Refer to note P, “Borrowings,” for additional details of financing this transaction.\n\nThe indenture governing our debt securities and our various credit facilities each contain significant covenants which obligate the company to promptly pay principal and interest, limit the aggregate amount of secured indebtedness and sale and leaseback transactions to 10 percent of IBM’s consolidated net tangible assets, and restrict our ability to merge or consolidate unless certain conditions are met. The credit facilities also include a covenant on our consolidated net interest expense ratio, which cannot be less than 2.20 to 1.0, as well as a cross default provision with respect to other defaulted indebtedness of at least $500 million.\n\nWe are in compliance with all of our significant debt covenants and provide periodic certification to our lenders. The failure to comply with debt covenants could constitute an event of default with respect to our debt to which such provisions apply. If certain events of default were to occur, the principal and interest on the debt to which such event of default applied would become immediately due and payable.\n\nWe do not have “ratings trigger” provisions in our debt covenants or documentation, which would allow the holders to declare an event of default and seek to accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating. Our contractual agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the agreement if IBM’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade. At December 31, 2019, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was $673 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of the company’s outstanding instruments and market conditions. We have no other contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would result in a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity.\n\nIn July 2017, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. Various central bank committees and working groups continue to discuss replacement of benchmark rates, the process for amending existing LIBOR-based contracts, and the potential economic impacts of different alternatives. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred alternative rate for USD LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. We are evaluating the potential impact of the replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, including risk management, internal operational readiness and monitoring the FASB standard-setting process to address financial reporting issues that might arise in connection with transition from LIBOR to a new benchmark rate.\n\nWe prepare our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with applicable accounting standards for cash flow presentation on page 71 and highlight causes and events underlying sources and uses of cash in that format on page 45. For the purpose of running its business, IBM manages, monitors and analyzes cash flows in a different format.\n\nManagement uses free cash flow as a measure to evaluate its operating results, plan share repurchase levels, strategic investments and assess its ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. We define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and net cash from operating activities that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables. Free cash flow guidance is derived using an estimate of profit, working capital and operational cash flows. Since we view Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment which we seek to maximize, it is not considered when formulating guidance for free cash flow. As a result, we do not estimate a GAAP Net Cash from Operations expectation metric.', 'Statements of Cash Flows\n\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow related activities (in thousands):\n\nYears Ended December 31, 2018\n\n2019\n\n2017\n\nCash (used in) provided by:\n\nOperating activities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, consisting of net loss of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $26.2 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $16.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $10.0 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an outflow from the changes in accrued liabilities and other of $5.9 million and inventory of $5.6 million, partially offset by an inflow from changes in deferred revenue of $3.2 million.\n\nThe unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and other was driven by an increase in lease liabilities associated with the lease of the San Jose corporate office. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to build up of inventory and timing of shipments, partially offset by increased reserves. The favorable change in deferred revenues was primarily driven by increased bookings.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million, consisting of net loss of $27.6 million which includes payments for our internal investigation costs of $8.6 million, non-cash charges of $25.0 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.9 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $3.1 million, offset primarily by an outflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $6.1 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and inventory of $1.5 million.\n\nThe favorable change in deferred revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the sale of subscription and support. The favorable change in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, increased value added tax accrual due to timing of payments, and an increase in legal fees accrual. The unfavorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections. The unfavorable change in prepaid and other assets was mainly driven by the increase in deferred sales commissions due to higher deferred revenue and higher average commission rate. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to the timing of shipments.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $14.3 million, consisting of a net loss of $10.8 million, a cash decrease resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million and non-cash charges of $26.4 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $17.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance of $1.1 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $12.4 million and deferred revenue of $3.0 million, and an outflow from the change in accrued liabilities of $8.9 million, inventory of $4.7 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and accounts payable of $0.9 million.\n\n']","Operating free cash flow consists of net cash from operating activities minus the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software.

Volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was flat in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior-year period. This result reflected merchandising changes and price elasticity-related declines in certain brands, as well as isolated production challenges, partially offset by the continued benefit from momentum and innovation successes in the snacks businesses. Price/ mix was flat compared to the prior year as unfavorable mix, coupled with increases in brand building investments with retailers were offset by the impact of higher pricing. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC, which was completed in October 2017, contributed $41.3 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 results included $115.9 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $156.4 million of net sales related to this divested business.\n\nRefrigerated & Frozen net sales for fiscal 2019 were $2.80 billion, an increase of $51.0 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 1% increase in volume compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales volumes was a result of innovation across multiple brands, which was partially offset by the effects of reduced merchandising spend and the impact of a recall during the fourth quarter. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2018, as continued delivery of top-line accretive innovation in several brands was partially offset by brand building investments with retailers. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business, which was completed in February 2018, contributed $25.7 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition.\n\nInternational net sales for fiscal 2019 were $793.4 million, a decrease of $50.1 million, or 6%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 2% increase in volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, a 4% decrease due to foreign exchange rates, and a 2% increase in price/mix, in each case compared to fiscal 2018. The volume and price/ mix increases for fiscal 2019 were driven by growth in the Canadian snacks and frozen businesses. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $3.7 million to International net sales for fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 included $4.1 million of net sales related to our Del Monte® processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada, which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $48.9 million of net sales related to this divested business. In addition, fiscal 2019 and 2018 results included $17.1 million and $24.5 million, respectively, related to our divested Wesson® oil business.\n\nFoodservice net sales for fiscal 2019 were $934.2 million, a decrease of $120.6 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 14% decrease in volume, excluding divestitures. The decline in volume reflected the continued execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy and the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Price/mix increased 5% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in price/mix for fiscal 2019 reflected favorable product and customer mix, the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing, and the execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy. Fiscal 2019 included $34.2 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $53.4 million of net sales related to this divested business. Net sales declined by approximately 7% in fiscal 2019 due to the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility.\n\nPinnacle Foods net sales for fiscal 2019 (reflecting 213 days of Conagra Brands ownership) were $1.73 billion.

The additions for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019 and 2018 are primarily related to the impacts of the Tax Act and taxation of certain intercompany transactions. The additions for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 are primarily related to certain non-U.S. net operating loss carry forwards, previously offset with a valuation allowance, that can no longer be recognized due to an internal restructuring. The reductions from settlements with taxing authorities for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 are primarily related to the settlement of a U.S. audit.\n\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax\n\nexpense.

All of the NOL carryforward was incurred subsequent to the enactment of the TCJA and therefore has an indefinite carryforward period. The Company has significant deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to property, plant and equipment, which are expected to reverse and allow for the full utilization of the NOL carryforward. As such, the Company has not recorded a valuation allowance related to the NOL carryforward. Also included in the deferred tax assets are North Carolina Investing in Business Property Credit and North Carolina Jobs Credits totaling $4.9 million, as well as Georgia Job Tax Credits totaling $2.6 million. The North Carolina Investing in Business Property Credit provides a 7% investment tax credit for property located in a North Carolina development area, the North Carolina Creating Jobs Credit provides a tax credit for increased employment in North Carolina, and the Georgia Job Tax Credit provides a tax credit for creation and retention of qualifying jobs in Georgia. It is management’s opinion that the majority of the North Carolina and Georgia income tax credits will not be utilized before they expire, and a $5.6 million valuation allowance has been recorded as of October 31, 2019.

Volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was flat in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior-year period. This result reflected merchandising changes and price elasticity-related declines in certain brands, as well as isolated production challenges, partially offset by the continued benefit from momentum and innovation successes in the snacks businesses. Price/ mix was flat compared to the prior year as unfavorable mix, coupled with increases in brand building investments with retailers were offset by the impact of higher pricing. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC, which was completed in October 2017, contributed $41.3 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 results included $115.9 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.

The increase in sales volumes was a result of innovation across multiple brands, which was partially offset by the effects of reduced merchandising spend and the impact of a recall during the fourth quarter. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2018, as continued delivery of top-line accretive innovation in several brands was partially offset by brand building investments with retailers. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business, which was completed in February 2018, contributed $25.7 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition.\n\nInternational net sales for fiscal 2019 were $793.4 million, a decrease of $50.1 million, or 6%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 2% increase in volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, a 4% decrease due to foreign exchange rates, and a 2% increase in price/mix, in each case compared to fiscal 2018. The volume and price/ mix increases for fiscal 2019 were driven by growth in the Canadian snacks and frozen businesses. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $3.7 million to International net sales for fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 included $4.1 million of net sales related to our Del Monte® processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada, which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.

Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 14% decrease in volume, excluding divestitures. The decline in volume reflected the continued execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy and the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Price/mix increased 5% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in price/mix for fiscal 2019 reflected favorable product and customer mix, the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing, and the execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy. Fiscal 2019 included $34.2 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $53.4 million of net sales related to this divested business.

Significant estimates include the rebates related to revenue recognition, stock based compensation and the valuation of inventory, long-lived assets, finite lived intangible assets and goodwill. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements: In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases.

The amended guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those reporting periods, with early adoption permitted. The guidance will be applied on a modified retrospective basis with the earliest period presented. Based on the effective date, this guidance will apply beginning October 1, 2019. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have no impact to retained earnings or net income. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02 on October 1, 2019, we anticipate recording a right-of-use asset and an offsetting lease liability of approximately $2.3 to $2.9 million.\n\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 Intangibles-Goodwill, which offers amended guidance to simplify the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. A goodwill impairment will now be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This guidance is to be applied on a prospective basis effective for the Company’s interim and annual periods beginning after January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted for any impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017.

All gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. In addition the Group employs Net Investment Hedge Accounting in order to mitigate these impacts where appropriate.\n\nTransactional (or non-structural) exposures give rise to net currency gains and losses that are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. Such exposures include the monetary assets and monetary liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position that are not denominated in the operating (or functional) currency of the operating unit involved. At 31st December 2019 the currency exposures in respect of the euro was a net monetary liability of £184.6m (2018: £191.1m net monetary liability) and in respect of the US dollar a net monetary liability of £0.2m (2018: net monetary liability £40.5m).\n\nAt 31st December 2019, the percentage of debt to net assets, excluding debt was 20% (2018: 29%) for the euro, 1% (2018: 5%) for the US dollar and nil (2018: 1%) for the Chinese renminbi.\n\n193', 'The following table presents the fair value of our derivatives instruments on a gross basis:\n\n(In millions) June 30, 2019 Derivative assets Derivative liabilities June 30, 2018 Derivative assets Derivative liabilities\n\nLevel 1\n\nLevel 2\n\n$ 0 $ 247 $\n\n0\n\n(272)\n\n1 (1)\n\n535 (206)\n\nLevel 3\n\nTotal\n\n3 $ 250 (272)\n\n0\n\n2 0\n\n538 (207)\n\nFair Value Hedge Gains (Losses)\n\nWe recognized in other income (expense), net the following gains (losses) on contracts designated as fair value hedges and their related hedged items:\n\n(In millions) Year Ended June 30, Foreign Exchange Contracts Derivatives Hedged items\n\nTotal amount of ineffectiveness\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\n$ 38 $ 25 $ 441 130 (386) $ 168 $ 103 $ 55\n\n78\n\nEquity Contracts Derivatives Hedged items\n\nTotal amount of ineffectiveness Amount of equity contracts excluded from effectiveness assessment\n\n$\n\n$\n\n$\n\n0 $ (324) $ (74) 74 0 0 0 $ 0 $ 80 $ (80)\n\n324\n\n0 $\n\nCash Flow Hedge Gains (Losses)\n\nWe recognized the following gains (losses) on foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges:\n\n(In millions) Year Ended June 30, Effective Portion Gains recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax of $1, $11, and $4 Gains reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into revenue Amount Excluded from Effectiveness Assessment and Ineffective Portion Losses recognized in other income (expense), net\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\n$ 159 $ 219 $ 328 555 185 341\n\n(64)\n\n(255)\n\n(389)\n\nWe do not have any net derivative gains included in AOCI as of June 30, 2019 that will be reclassified into earnings within the following 12 months.

What is the company paid on a cost-plus type contract?,"['We only include amounts representing contract change orders, claims or other items in the contract value when we believe the rights and obligations become enforceable. Contract modifications routinely occur to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. In most cases, contract modifications are for goods or services that are not distinct and, therefore, are accounted for as part of the existing contract. Transaction price estimates include additional consideration for submitted contract modifications or claims when we believe there is an enforceable right to the modification or claim, the amount can be reliably estimated, and its realization is reasonably assured. Amounts representing modifications accounted for as part of the existing contract are included in the transaction price and recognized as an adjustment to sales on a cumulative catch-up basis.\n\nIn addition, we are subject to audits of incurred costs related to many of our U.S. government contracts. These audits could produce different results than we have estimated for revenue recognized on our cost-based contracts with the U.S. government; however, our experience has been that our costs are acceptable to the government.\n\nContract Estimates\n\nUse of the cost-to-cost or other similar methods of revenue recognition requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the revenue and cost associated with the design, manufacture and delivery of our products and services. Revisions or adjustments to estimates of the transaction price, estimated costs at completion and estimated profit or loss of a performance obligation are often required as work progresses under a contract, as experience is gained, as facts and circumstances change and as new information is obtained, even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change. In determining the estimated costs at completion, we have to make assumptions regarding labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, estimated increases in wages and prices for materials, performance by our subcontractors, and the availability and timing of funding from our customer, among other variables. Revisions or adjustments to our estimated transaction price and estimated costs at completion may also be required if contract modifications occur. The revisions in contract estimates, if significant, can materially affect our results of operations and cash flows, and in some cases result in liabilities to complete contracts in a loss position. Based upon our history, we believe we have the ability to make reasonable estimates for these items. We have accounting policies and controls in place to address these, as well as other contractual and business arrangements to properly account for long-term contracts, and we continue to monitor and improve such policies, controls, and arrangements. For other information on such policies, controls and arrangements, see our discussion in Item 9A of this Form 10-K.\n\nProducts and services provided under long-term, fixed-price contracts represented approximately 97% of our sales for 2019. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if our underlying circumstances were to change. For example, if underlying assumptions were to change such that our estimated profit rate at completion for all fixed-price contracts accounted for under the cost-to-cost percentage-of-completion method was higher or lower by one percentage point, our 2019 operating income would have increased or decreased by approximately $6.5 million. When adjustments in estimated contract revenues or estimated costs at completion are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized by recording adjustments in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of the changes on current and prior periods using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period the loss is determined.\n\nThe aggregate impact of net changes in contract estimates are presented in the table below (amounts in thousands).\n\nOperating income (loss) Net income (loss) from continuing operations Diluted earnings per share\n\nYears Ended September 30, 2018\n\n2019\n\n$ (2,235) $ (6,986) $ (5,146) (0.19)\n\n(2,351) (0.08)\n\n2017 5,737 3,208 0.12\n\n', 'Table of Contents\n\nrevenue consists of personnel costs for our technical support team.

From time to time, the Company may audit or otherwise dispute royalties reported from licensees. Any adjusted royalty revenue as a result of such audits or dispute is recorded by the Company in the period in which such adjustment is agreed to by the Company and the licensee or otherwise determined.\n\nRevenue from the Company’s patent licensing business is generated from negotiated license agreements. The timing and amount of revenue recognized from each licensee depends upon a variety of factors, including the terms of each agreement and the nature of the obligations of the parties. These agreements may include, but not be limited to, elements related to past infringement liabilities, non-refundable upfront license fees, and ongoing royalties on licensed products sold by the licensee. Generally, in the event of settlement of litigation related to the Company’s assertion of patent infringement involving its intellectual property, defendants will either pay (i) a non-refundable lump sum payment for a non-exclusive fully-paid license (a “Fully-Paid License”), or (ii) a non-refundable lump sum payment (license initiation fee) together with an ongoing obligation to pay quarterly or monthly royalties to the Company for the life of the licensed patent (a “Royalty Bearing License”).\n\nThe Company’s license agreements, both Fully-Paid Licenses and Royalty Bearing Licenses, typically include some combination of the following: (i) the grant of a non- exclusive license to manufacture and/or sell products covered by its patented technologies; (ii) the release of the licensee from certain claims, and (iii) the dismissal of any pending litigation. The intellectual property rights granted pursuant to these licenses typically extend until the expiration of the related patents. Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, the Company typically has no further performance obligations with respect to the grant of the non-exclusive licenses. Generally, the license agreements provide for the grant of the licenses, releases, and other obligations following execution of the agreement and the receipt of the up-front lump sum payment for a Fully-Paid License or a license initiation fee for a Royalty Bearing License.\n\nOngoing Royalty Payments: Certain of the Company’s revenue from Royalty Bearing Licenses results from the calculation of royalties based on a licensee’s actual quarterly sales (one licensee pays monthly royalties) of licensed products, applied to a contractual royalty rate. Licensees that pay royalties on a quarterly basis generally report to the Company actual quarterly sales and related quarterly royalties due within 45 days after the end of the quarter in which such sales activity takes place.

Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, consisting of net loss of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $26.2 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $16.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $10.0 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an outflow from the changes in accrued liabilities and other of $5.9 million and inventory of $5.6 million, partially offset by an inflow from changes in deferred revenue of $3.2 million.\n\nThe unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and other was driven by an increase in lease liabilities associated with the lease of the San Jose corporate office. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to build up of inventory and timing of shipments, partially offset by increased reserves. The favorable change in deferred revenues was primarily driven by increased bookings.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million, consisting of net loss of $27.6 million which includes payments for our internal investigation costs of $8.6 million, non-cash charges of $25.0 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.9 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $3.1 million, offset primarily by an outflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $6.1 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and inventory of $1.5 million.\n\nThe favorable change in deferred revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the sale of subscription and support. The favorable change in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, increased value added tax accrual due to timing of payments, and an increase in legal fees accrual. The unfavorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections. The unfavorable change in prepaid and other assets was mainly driven by the increase in deferred sales commissions due to higher deferred revenue and higher average commission rate. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to the timing of shipments.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $14.3 million, consisting of a net loss of $10.8 million, a cash decrease resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million and non-cash charges of $26.4 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $17.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance of $1.1 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $12.4 million and deferred revenue of $3.0 million, and an outflow from the change in accrued liabilities of $8.9 million, inventory of $4.7 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and accounts payable of $0.9 million.\n\n', 'General and administrative expensesGeneral and administrative expenses increased $9.1 million in the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the year ended March 31, 2017, which wasprimarily attributable to increases in personnel-related costs of $5.0 million, share-based compensation expense of $1.2 million, information technology andfacilities costs of $1.0 million and professional services costs and material supplies of $0.6 million each. General and administrative expenses for the yearended March 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2017 were negatively impacted by approximately $0.3 million primarily as a result of theweakening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and South African rand. Personnel-related costs increased primarily as a result of salaries and benefitsassociated with increased headcount. Share-based compensation expense increased primarily as a result of share option grants since the prior year.Information technology and facility and material supplies costs increased primarily as a result of increased headcount.Restructuring and Impairment of long-lived assetsIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, upon the exit of our Watertown, Massachusetts corporate office space, we recorded a restructuring charge of $0.8million for remaining non-cancelable rent and estimated operating expenses for the vacated premises, net of sublease rentals, and a non-cash impairmentcharge of $1.7 million primarily related to leasehold improvements.Other income (expense) Year ended March 31, Period-to-period change 2018 2017 Amount % Change (dollars in thousands) Other income (expense): Interest income $1,310 $510 $800 157%Interest expense (598) (268) (330) 123%Foreign exchange (expense) income and other, net (3,439) 6,892 (10,331) nm Total other income (expense), net $(2,727) $7,134 $(9,861) nm nm—not meaningful Other income (expense), net changed $9.9 million in the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the year ended March 31, 2017, which was primarilyattributable to a change of $10.4 million in foreign exchange expense which was primarily attributable to the re-measurement of short-term intercompanybalances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our operating units.

Unrecognized tax benefits of $246 million, including penalties, interest and indirect benefits, would affect our provision for income taxes if recognized. As a result of U.S. tax reform, we recorded provisional gross unrecognized tax benefits of $114 million during fiscal 2018.\n\nWe recognized a benefit for adjustments to accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision of approximately $4 million in fiscal 2019 and expense of $5 million in each of fiscal 2018 and 2017.

During fiscal 2019, we recognized a tax benefit of $48 million attributable to the effective settlement and the release of related tax reserves.\n\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was enacted into law. The TCJA made significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the imposition of a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign earnings, and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires companies to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment. However, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the TCJA enactment date.\n\nAs a result of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate change, effective as of January 1, 2018, we remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future periods. During fiscal 2018, we recorded $108 million of tax expense related to all tax rate changes. Upon finalization of our provisional estimates during the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we recorded tax expense of $6 million related to deferred tax assets for equity-based compensation awards to our executives.\n\nThe TCJA imposes a mandatory, one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and profits not previously subject to U.S.\n\nincome tax at a rate of 15.5% on earnings to the extent of foreign cash and other liquid assets, and 8% on the remaining earnings. In fiscal 2018, we recorded a $732 million discrete tax expense for the estimated U.S. federal and state income tax impacts of the transition tax. In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we finalized our computation of the transition tax and recorded a reduction of $5 million to our provisional estimate.\n\nAs of April 26, 2019, we have completed the accounting for the tax impacts of the TCJA, however, we will continue to assess the impact of further guidance from federal and state tax authorities on our business and consolidated financial statements, and recognize any adjustments in the period in which they are determined.\n\nUnder the TCJA, the global minimum tax on intangible income (GMT) provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a\n\ndeemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. Under U.S. GAAP, companies are allowed to make an accounting policy election to either (i) account for GMT as a component of tax expense in the period in which a company is subject to the rules, or (ii) account for GMT in a company’s measurement of deferred taxes. We have elected to recognize the GMT as a period cost and thus recorded $22 million of tax expense for federal and state impacts for fiscal 2019.\n\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued an ASU which eliminates the deferred tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers other than\n\ninventory. As a result, tax expense from the sale of an asset in the seller’s tax jurisdiction is recognized when the transfer occurs, even though the pre-tax effects of that transaction are eliminated in consolidation.\n\nDuring fiscal 2017, we adopted a new accounting standard that simplifies stock-based compensation income tax accounting and presentation within the financial statements and recorded a tax charge of $18 million following the post-adoption rules which require that all excess tax benefits and deficiencies from stock-based compensation be recognized as a component of income tax expense.\n\n80\n\nThe components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions):\n\nApril 26, 2019\n\nApril 27, 2018\n\nDeferred tax assets:\n\nReserves and accruals Net operating loss and credit carryforwards Stock-based compensation Deferred revenue Other\n\nGross deferred tax assets Valuation allowance\n\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance\n\n$\n\n50 $ 139 16 205 16 426 (123 ) 303\n\n57 131 22 156 29 395 (109 ) 286\n\nDeferred tax liabilities:\n\nPrepaids and accruals Acquired intangibles Property and equipment Other\n\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance and deferred tax liabilities\n\n$\n\n31 32 31 10 104 199 $\n\n21 29 25 14 89 197\n\nThe valuation allowance increased by $14 million in fiscal 2019. The increase is mainly attributable to corresponding changes in\n\ndeferred tax assets, primarily foreign tax credit carryforwards and certain state tax credit carryforwards.\n\nAs of April 26, 2019, we have federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $2 million and $3 million,\n\nrespectively. In addition, we have gross state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of $25 million and $138 million, respectively. The majority of the state credit carryforwards are California research credits which are offset by a valuation allowance as we believe it is more likely than not that these credits will not be utilized. We also have $4 million of foreign net operating losses, and $43 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards generated by our Dutch subsidiary which are fully offset by a valuation allowance. Certain acquired net operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382, but are expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance. The federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards and credits will expire in various years from fiscal 2020 through 2038. The California research credit and Dutch foreign tax credit carryforwards do not expire.\n\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):\n\nBalance at beginning of period\n\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year Additions for tax positions of prior years Decreases for tax positions of prior years Settlements\n\nBalance at end of period\n\nYear Ended April 27, 2018\n\n', ' GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act.

See Note 7, “Deferred Compensation,” for further discussion.\n\n16. Restructuring and other exit costs, net\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Board of Directors approved a world-wide restructuring plan (“Fiscal 2018 Plan”) to support the Company's strategic priorities of completing the subscription transition, digitizing the Company, and re-imagining manufacturing, construction, and production. Through the restructuring, Autodesk seeks to reduce its investments in areas not aligned with its strategic priorities, including in areas related to research and development and go-to-market activities. At the same time, Autodesk plans to further invest in strategic priority areas related to digital infrastructure, customer success, and construction. By re-balancing resources to better align with the Company’s strategic priorities, Autodesk is positioning itself to meet its long-term goals. This world-wide restructuring plan included a reduction in force of approximately 11% of the Company’s workforce, or 1,027 employees, and the consolidation of certain leased facilities. By January 31, 2019, the personnel and facilities related actions included in this restructuring plan were substantially complete.\n\nDuring Fiscal 2019, restructuring charges under the Fiscal 2018 Plan included $39.2 million in employee termination\n\nbenefits and $3.2 million in lease termination and other exit costs.\n\n2019 Form 10-K 104\n\n2017\n\n1.7% 2.6%\n\nThe following tables set forth the restructuring charges and other facility exit costs, net during the fiscal years ended\n\nJanuary 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\nBalances, January 31, 2018\n\nAdditions\n\nPayments\n\nAdjustments (1)\n\nBalances, January 31, 2019\n\nFiscal 2018 Plan\n\nEmployee terminations costs\n\n$\n\n53.0\n\n$\n\n39.2\n\n$\n\n(89.7) $\n\n(0.5) $\n\n2.0\n\nFacility terminations and other exit costs\n\n2.5\n\n3.2\n\n(5.7)\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n55.5\n\n$\n\n42.4\n\n$\n\n(95.4) $\n\n(0.4) $\n\n2.1\n\nCurrent portion (2)\n\n$\n\n55.5\n\n$\n\n2.1\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n55.5\n\n$\n\n2.1\n\n____________________ (1) Adjustments primarily relate to the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, settlement of lease contracts, and certain write offs related\n\n(2)\n\nto fixed assets.

Volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was flat in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior-year period. This result reflected merchandising changes and price elasticity-related declines in certain brands, as well as isolated production challenges, partially offset by the continued benefit from momentum and innovation successes in the snacks businesses. Price/ mix was flat compared to the prior year as unfavorable mix, coupled with increases in brand building investments with retailers were offset by the impact of higher pricing. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC, which was completed in October 2017, contributed $41.3 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 results included $115.9 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $156.4 million of net sales related to this divested business.\n\nRefrigerated & Frozen net sales for fiscal 2019 were $2.80 billion, an increase of $51.0 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 1% increase in volume compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales volumes was a result of innovation across multiple brands, which was partially offset by the effects of reduced merchandising spend and the impact of a recall during the fourth quarter. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2018, as continued delivery of top-line accretive innovation in several brands was partially offset by brand building investments with retailers. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business, which was completed in February 2018, contributed $25.7 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition.\n\nInternational net sales for fiscal 2019 were $793.4 million, a decrease of $50.1 million, or 6%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 2% increase in volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, a 4% decrease due to foreign exchange rates, and a 2% increase in price/mix, in each case compared to fiscal 2018. The volume and price/ mix increases for fiscal 2019 were driven by growth in the Canadian snacks and frozen businesses. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $3.7 million to International net sales for fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 included $4.1 million of net sales related to our Del Monte® processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada, which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $48.9 million of net sales related to this divested business. In addition, fiscal 2019 and 2018 results included $17.1 million and $24.5 million, respectively, related to our divested Wesson® oil business.\n\nFoodservice net sales for fiscal 2019 were $934.2 million, a decrease of $120.6 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 14% decrease in volume, excluding divestitures. The decline in volume reflected the continued execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy and the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Price/mix increased 5% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in price/mix for fiscal 2019 reflected favorable product and customer mix, the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing, and the execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy. Fiscal 2019 included $34.2 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $53.4 million of net sales related to this divested business. Net sales declined by approximately 7% in fiscal 2019 due to the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility.\n\nPinnacle Foods net sales for fiscal 2019 (reflecting 213 days of Conagra Brands ownership) were $1.73 billion. Results reflected expected consumption declines as the Company executes its value-over-volume strategy within the Pinnacle portfolio.\n\n26\n\n% Inc (Dec)\n\n— %\n\n2 %\n\n(6)%\n\n(11)%\n\n100 %\n\n"", 'Advertising Costs: Advertising costs amounted to $278,057, $365,859, and $378,217, for the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, and are charged to expense when incurred.\n\nNet Income Per Share: Basic and diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and the weighted average number of dilutive shares outstanding, respectively.\n\nWeighted average common shares outstanding for the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were as follows:\n\nYear ended September 30, Net income Weighted average common shares Dilutive potential common shares Weighted average dilutive common shares outstanding Earnings per share:\n\n$\n\n2019\n\n4,566,156 $ 13,442,871 8,343 13,451,214\n\n2018 4,274,547 $ 13,429,232 23,628 13,452,860\n\nBasic Diluted\n\n$ $\n\n0.34 $ 0.34 $\n\n0.32 $ 0.32 $\n\nThere were 268,000 and 108,000 shares for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, that were excluded from the above calculation as they were considered antidilutive in nature. No shares were considered antidilutive for the year ended September 30, 2017.\n\nUse of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, related revenues and expenses and disclosure about contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Significant estimates include the rebates related to revenue recognition, stock based compensation and the valuation of inventory, long-lived assets, finite lived intangible assets and goodwill. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements: In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. There have been further amendments, including practical expedients, with the issuance of ASU 2018-01 in January 2018, ASU 2018-11 in July 2018 and ASU 2018-20 in December 2018. The amended guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those reporting periods, with early adoption permitted. The guidance will be applied on a modified retrospective basis with the earliest period presented. Based on the effective date, this guidance will apply beginning October 1, 2019. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have no impact to retained earnings or net income. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02 on October 1, 2019, we anticipate recording a right-of-use asset and an offsetting lease liability of approximately $2.3 to $2.9 million.\n\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 Intangibles-Goodwill, which offers amended guidance to simplify the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. A goodwill impairment will now be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This guidance is to be applied on a prospective basis effective for the Company’s interim and annual periods beginning after January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted for any impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. The Company does not believe the adoption of this ASU will have a material impact on our financial statements.\n\n36\n\n2017 3,847,839 13,532,375 128,431 13,660,806\n\n0.28 0.']","The net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019, were $93,662,000.","$ 93,662",1.0,0.9999999999,0.9999999999,0.0,0.9898605961123907

We also present Free Cash Flow, which is a non-U.S. GAAP measure, defined as (i) net cash from operating activities plus (ii) net cash used in investing activities, excluding payment for purchases (and proceeds from the sale) of marketable securities, and net cash variation for joint ventures deconsolidation, which are considered as temporary financial investments. The result of this definition is ultimately net cash from operating activities plus payment for purchase and proceeds from sale of tangible, intangible and financial assets, proceeds received in the sale of businesses and cash paid for business acquisitions. We believe Free Cash Flow, a non-U.S. GAAP measure, provides useful information for investors and management because it measures our capacity to generate cash from our operating and investing activities to sustain our operations. Free Cash Flow is not a U.S. GAAP measure and does not represent total cash flow since it does not include the cash flows generated by or used in financing activities. Free Cash Flow reconciles with the total cash flow and the net cash increase (decrease) by including the payment for purchases (and proceeds from the sale) of marketable securities and net cash variation from joint ventures deconsolidation, the net cash from (used in) financing activities and the effect of changes in exchange rates. In addition, our definition of Free Cash Flow may differ from definitions used by other companies.

The Company has historically renewed most of these contracts. However, there is no assurance that these contracts will be renewed, or if renewed, will be on terms as favorable as the existing contracts. Each line of business is governed by separate business terms, conditions and metrics.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTThe Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is determined based upon the exit price that would be received to sellan asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, as determined by either the principal market or the most advantageousmarket. Inputs used in the valuation techniques to derive fair values are classified based on a three-level hierarchy, as follows:Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2—Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets with insufficient volumeor infrequent transactions (less active markets), or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from orcorroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3—Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities.The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

IMFT is governed by a Board of Managers, for which the number of managers appointed by each member varies based on the members' respective ownership interests. IMFT manufactures semiconductor products exclusively for its members under a long-term supply agreement at prices approximating cost. In 2018, IMFT discontinued production of NAND and subsequent to that time manufactured 3D XPoint memory. In 2018, we announced that we and Intel will no longer jointly develop 3D XPoint technology beyond the second generation and we substantially completed this cost-sharing arrangement in the first quarter of 2020. IMFT sales to Intel were $731 million, $507 million, and $493 million for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\n\nIMFT's capital requirements are generally determined based on an annual plan approved by the members, and capital contributions to IMFT are requested as needed. Capital requests are made to the members in proportion to their then-current ownership interest. Members may elect to not contribute their proportional share, and in such event, the contributing member may elect to contribute any amount of the capital request, either in the form of an equity contribution or member debt financing. Under the supply agreement, the members have rights and obligations to the capacity of IMFT in proportion to their investment, including member debt financing. Any capital contribution or member debt financing results in a proportionate adjustment to the sharing of output on an eight-month lag. Pursuant to the terms of the IMFT joint venture agreement, Intel provided debt financing of $1.01 billion to IMFT in 2018 and IMFT repaid $316 million to Intel in 2019. As of August 29, 2019, current debt included $693 million of IMFT Member Debt. Members pay their proportionate share of fixed costs associated with IMFT's capacity.\n\nIn January 2019, we exercised our option to acquire Intel's interest in IMFT. Subsequently, Intel set the closing date to occur on October 31, 2019, at which time IMFT will become a wholly-owned subsidiary. In the first quarter of 2020, we expect to pay Intel approximately $1.4 billion in cash for Intel's noncontrolling interest in IMFT and IMFT member debt. Pursuant to the terms of the IMFT wafer supply agreement, Intel notified us of its election to receive supply from IMFT from the closing date through April 2020 at a volume equal to approximately 50% of their volume from IMFT in the six-month period prior to closing.\n\n68\n\nCreditors of IMFT have recourse only to IMFT's assets and do not have recourse to any other of our assets.

The fair values of the customer-related intangibles were determined using the distributor method, a form of the income approach based on distributor margin and expected attrition and revenue growth for Microsemi's existing customers as of the acquisition date. Customer relationships are being amortized in a manner based on the estimated cash flows associated with the existing customers and anticipated retention rates.\n\nBacklog relates to the value of orders not yet shipped by Microsemi at the acquisition date, and the fair values are being determined based on the estimated profit associated with those orders. Backlog related assets have a one year useful life and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over that period.\n\nThe total weighted average amortization period of intangible assets acquired as a result of the Microsemi transaction is 13\n\nyears. Amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets is not deductible for tax purposes. Thus, approximately $856.7 million was established as a net deferred tax liability for the future amortization of the intangible assets.\n\nThe amount of Microsemi net sales and net loss included in the Company's consolidated statements of income for the fiscal\n\nyear ended March 31, 2019 was approximately $1,568.6 million and $570.8 million, respectively.\n\nThe following unaudited pro-forma consolidated results of operations for the fiscal year ended March 31,\n\n2019 and 2018 assume the closing of the Microsemi acquisition occurred as of April 1, 2017.

The Company\n\npaid an aggregate of approximately $2.98 billion in cash and issued an aggregate of 10.1 million shares of its common stock to Atmel stockholders valued at $486.1 million based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on April 4, 2016 and incurred transaction and other fees of approximately $14.9 million. The total consideration transferred in the acquisition, including approximately $7.5 million of non-cash consideration for the exchange of certain share-based payment awards of Atmel for stock awards of the Company, was approximately $3.47 billion. In addition to the consideration transferred, the Company recognized in its consolidated financial statements $653.0 million in liabilities of Atmel consisting of debt, taxes payable and deferred, pension obligations, restructuring, and contingent and other liabilities. The Company financed the cash portion of the purchase price using approximately $2.04 billion of cash held by certain of its foreign subsidiaries and approximately $0.94 billion from additional borrowings under its existing credit agreement. As a result of the acquisition, Atmel became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Atmel is a worldwide leader in the design and manufacture of microcontrollers, capacitive touch solutions, advanced logic, mixed-signal, nonvolatile memory and radio frequency components. The Company's primary reason for this acquisition was to expand the Company's range of solutions, products and capabilities by extending its served available market.\n\nThe acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting, with the Company identified as the acquirer, and the operating results of Atmel have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements as of the closing date of the acquisition. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the aggregate amount of consideration paid by the Company was allocated to Atmel's net tangible assets and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of April 4, 2016. The excess of the purchase price over the value of the net tangible assets and intangible assets was recorded to goodwill. The factors contributing to the recognition of goodwill were based upon the Company's conclusion that there are strategic and synergistic benefits that are expected to be realized from the acquisition.

This was primarily due to (i) a decrease in commissions expense of $6.6 million, of which approximately $8.9 million is the net result of the Company capitalizing more commission expense under Topic 606, whereas previously, under Topic 605, such costs would have been expensed as incurred, (ii) a decrease in marketing expenses of $5.7 million and (iii) a decrease in travel and communication expenses of $1.1 million. These were partially offset by (i) an increase in bad debt expense of $3.5 million as certain low dollar receivables were provided for entirely as they became aged greater than one year.
