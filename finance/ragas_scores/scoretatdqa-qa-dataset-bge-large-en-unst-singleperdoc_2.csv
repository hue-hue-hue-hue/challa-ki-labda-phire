Additionally, the balance excludes contractual obligations recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as current liabilities.\n\nOperating Leases\n\nWe lease most of our administrative, R&D, and manufacturing facilities; regional sales/service offices; and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Certain of our facility leases for buildings located in Fremont and Livermore, California; Tualatin, Oregon; and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. In addition to amounts included in the table above, we have guaranteed residual values for certain of our Fremont and Livermore facility leases of up to $250 million. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2019 Form 10-K for further discussion.\n\nCapital Leases\n\nCapital leases reflect building and office equipment lease obligations. The amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations.\n\nPurchase Obligations\n\nPurchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor-consigned inventories. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at June 30, 2019, under these arrangements and others. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nDuring the December 2017 quarter, a one-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings, estimated at $991 million, was recognized associated with the December 2017 U.S. tax reform. In accordance with SAB 118, we finalized the amount of the transition tax during the period ended December 23, 2018. The final amount is $868.4 million. The Company elected\n\nContinues on next page (cid:2)\n\nLam Research Corporation 2019 10-K 37\n\n38\n\nto pay the one-time transition tax over a period of eight years with 8% of the transition tax to be paid each September 15 for years 2018 through 2022, and 15%, 20%, and 25%, respectively, to be paid each September 15 for years 2023 through 2025.\n\nLong-Term Debt\n\nIn June 2012, with the acquisition of Novellus, we assumed $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due May 2041. We pay cash interest on the 2041 Notes at an annual rate of 2.625%, on a semi-annual basis. The 2041 Notes may be converted, under certain circumstances, into our Common Stock.\n\nDuring the quarter-ended June 30, 2019, the market value of our Common Stock was greater than or equal to 130% of the 2041 Notes conversion prices for 20 or more trading days of the 30 consecutive trading days preceding the quarter end. As a result, the 2041 Notes are convertible at the option of the holder and are classified as current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for fiscal year 2019.\n\nOn March 12, 2015, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due March 15, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”) and $500 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due March 15, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”). We pay interest at an annual rate of 2.75% and 3.80%, respectively, on the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes, on a semi-annual basis on March 15 and September 15 of each year.\n\nOn June 7, 2016, we completed a public offering of $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due June 15, 2021, (the “2021 Notes”), together with the 2020 Notes, and 2021 Notes, the “Senior Notes”, and collectively with the Convertible Notes, the “Notes”).

A share conversion ratio of 1.35 was applied to convert Red Hat’s outstanding equity awards for Red Hat’s common stock into IBM stock awards. At December 31, 2019, there were 4.6 million of these stock awards outstanding with a weighted-average grant price of $140 per share.\n\nGranted\n\n$674\n\n$583\n\n$484\n\nVested\n\nPSUs\n\nGranted\n\nVested\n\n428\n\n$164\n\n118\n\n381\n\n$118\n\n101\n\n463\n\n$113\n\n51\n\nIn connection with various other acquisition transactions, there was an additional 0.1 million stock options outstanding at December 31, 2019, as a result of the company’s conversion of stock-based awards previously granted by acquired entities. The weighted-average exercise price of these awards was $43 per share.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, there was $1.1 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs, which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining weighted- average contractual term of approximately 2.5 years.\n\nIn connection with vesting and release of RSUs and PSUs, the tax benefits realized by the company for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $131 million, $117 million and $180 million, respectively.\n\nStock Options In 2016, the company made one grant of 1.5 million premium- priced stock options. The option award was granted with a three-year cliff vesting period and a 10-year contractual term. The award’s cost of $12 million was recognized ratably over the three-year vesting period. As of December 31, 2019, these options were vested with a weighted-average exercise price of $140 per share and had a remaining weighted-average contractual life of approximately 6.1 years. The options were exercisable within a range of $129 to $154. The total intrinsic value of these vested options as of December 31, 2019 was $1.9 million.\n\nThe company has not granted options since 2016. No stock options were exercised, forfeited or canceled during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $7 million. In connection with this exercise, $11 million in cash was received from employees and the company realized a tax benefit of $2 million.\n\nIBM Employees Stock Purchase Plan The company maintains a non-compensatory Employees Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP enables eligible participants to purchase shares of IBM common stock at a 5 percent discount off the average market price on the day of purchase through payroll deductions of up to 10 percent of eligible compensation. Eligible compensation includes any compensation received by the employee during the year. The ESPP provides for semi-annual offering periods during which shares may be purchased and continues as long as shares remain available under the ESPP, unless terminated earlier at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Individual ESPP participants are restricted from purchasing more than $25,000 of common stock in one calendar year or 1,000 shares in an offering period.\n\nEmployees purchased approximately 1.0 million shares under the ESPP during each year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Cash dividends declared and paid by the company on its common stock also include cash dividends on the company stock purchased through the ESPP. Dividends are paid on full and fractional shares and can be reinvested. The company stock purchased through the ESPP is considered outstanding and is included in the weighted-average outstanding shares for purposes of computing basic and diluted earnings per share.\n\nApproximately 18.8 million shares were available for purchase under the ESPP at December 31, 2019.\n\nThe company settles employee stock option exercises primarily with newly issued common shares and, occasionally, with treasury shares. Total treasury shares held at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were approximately 1,351 million and 1,341 million shares, respectively.', "" The amount of incremental PRSU awards thatcould ultimately vest if all performance criteria are achieved would be 1,196,337 shares assuming a maximum of 300% of the targeted shares.We granted 200,000 market-based RSUs during fiscal year 2019, at a weighted average grant date fair value of $17.65 per share, and a total fair value of $3.5million. Recipients may earn between 0% and 150% of the target number of shares based on the Company's achievement of total shareholder return in comparisonto a peer group of companies in the Nasdaq composite index over a period of approximately three years. The fair value of the awards was estimated using a MonteCarlo simulation and compensation expense is recognized ratably over the service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards of $3.5 million subject tothe market condition. The expected volatility of the Company's common stock was estimated based on the historical average volatility rate over the three-yearperiod. The dividend yield assumption was based on historical and anticipated dividend payouts. The risk-free rate assumption was based on observed interest ratesconsistent with the three-year measurement period. The assumptions used to value the awards are as follows:79"", 'Stock Awards\n\nWe have granted RSUs to our employees, consultants and members of our Board of Directors, and PSUs to\n\ncertain executives.\n\nIn February 2016, we granted 547,000 PSUs with certain financial and operational targets. Actual performance, as measured at the time and prior to the restatement of the 2016 financial statements, resulted in participants achieving 80% of target. Given the PSUs did not contain explicit or implicit claw back rights, there was no change to stock-based compensation expense for the impact of the previously disclosed restatement of the 2016 consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2019, 253,203 shares had vested, 200,297 shares had been forfeited, and the remaining 93,500 shares will vest (as to 80%) in annual tranches through February 2020 subject to continued service vesting requirements.\n\nIn October 2018, we granted 464,888 PSUs with certain financial targets.

Is the defined benefit plan open to new members?,"['172 Vodafone Group Plc\n\nAnnual Report 2019\n\n24. Post employment benefits\n\nThe Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans for our employees. The Group’s largest defined benefit scheme is in the UK. For further details see “Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty” in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAccounting policies For defined benefit retirement plans, the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the plan liabilities is recognised as an asset or liability on the statement of financial position. Scheme liabilities are assessed using the projected unit funding method and applying the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting period date. Assets are valued at market value.\n\nActuarial gains and losses are taken to the statement of comprehensive income as incurred. For this purpose, actuarial gains and losses comprise both the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising from differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred. The return on plan assets, in excess of interest income, and costs incurred for the management of plan assets are also taken to other comprehensive income.\n\nOther movements in the net surplus or deficit are recognised in the income statement, including the current service cost, any past service cost and the effect of any settlements. The interest cost less the expected interest income on assets is also charged to the income statement. The amount charged to the income statement in respect of these plans is included within operating costs or in the Group’s share of the results of equity accounted operations, as appropriate.\n\nThe Group’s contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the income statement as they fall due.\n\nBackground At 31 March 2019 the Group operated a number of pension plans for the benefit of its employees throughout the world, with varying rights and obligations depending on the conditions and practices in the countries concerned. The Group’s pension plans are provided through both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements. Defined benefit schemes provide benefits based on the employees’ length of pensionable service and their final pensionable salary or other criteria. Defined contribution schemes offer employees individual funds that are converted into benefits at the time of retirement.\n\nThe Group operates defined benefit schemes in Germany, Ghana, India, Ireland, Italy, the UK, the United States and the Group operates defined benefit indemnity plans in Greece and Turkey. Defined contribution pension schemes are currently provided in Egypt, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Portugal, South Africa, Spain and the UK.\n\nIncome statement expense\n\nDefined contribution schemes Defined benefit schemes Total amount charged to income statement (note 23)\n\n2019 €m 166 57 223\n\n2018 €m 178 44 222\n\n2017 €m 192 20 212\n\nDefined benefit schemes The Group’s retirement policy is to provide competitive pension provision, in each operating country, in line with the market median for that location. The Group’s preferred retirement provision is focused on Defined Contribution (‘DC’) arrangements and/or State provision for future service.\n\nThe Group’s main defined benefit funding liability is the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme (‘Vodafone UK plan’). Since June 2014 the plan has consisted of two segregated sections: the Vodafone Section and the Cable & Wireless Section (‘CWW Section’). Both sections are closed to new entrants and to future accrual. The Group also operates smaller funded and unfunded plans in the UK, funded and unfunded plans in Germany and funded plans in Ireland. Defined benefit pension provision exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as longer than expected longevity of participants, lower than expected return on investments and higher than expected inflation, which may increase the liabilities or reduce the value of assets of the schemes.\n\nThe main defined benefit schemes are administered by trustee boards which are legally separate from the Group and consist of representatives who are employees, former employees or are independent from the Company. The boards of the pension schemes are required by legislation to act in the best interest of the participants, set the investment strategy and contribution rates and are subject to statutory funding objectives.\n\nThe Vodafone UK plan is registered as an occupational pension plan with HM Revenue and Customs (‘HMRC’) and is subject to UK legislation and operates within the framework outlined by the Pensions Regulator. UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently and that valuations are undertaken at least every three years. Separate valuations are required for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section.\n\nThe trustees obtain regular actuarial valuations to check whether the statutory funding objective is met and whether a recovery plan is required to restore funding to the level of the agreed technical provisions. On 19 October 2017, the 31 March 2016 triennial actuarial valuation for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section of the Vodafone UK plan, which is used to judge the funding the Group needs to put into the scheme, was concluded.', ""2 0 1 9 A n n u a l\n\nR e p o r t\n\nreturn appropriate for each category of assets weighted for the distribution within the diversified investment fund. The assumptions used for the plans are based upon customary rates and practices for the location of the plans. Factors such as asset class allocations, long-term rates of return (actual and expected), and results of periodic asset liability modeling studies are considered when constructing the long-term rate of return assumption for our defined benefit pension plans.\n\nWeighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the plans at the end of each period were\n\nas follows:\n\nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nDiscount rate Rate of compensation increase\n\n2.0% 2.7%\n\n1.8% 2.6%\n\nIn selecting the appropriate discount rate for the plans, the Company uses country-specific information, adjusted to reflect\n\nthe duration of the particular plan. The discount rate was based on highly rated long-term bond indexes and yield curves that match the duration of the plan’s benefit obligations.\n\nDefined Contribution Plans\n\nAutodesk also provides defined contribution plans in certain foreign countries where required by statute. Autodesk’s funding policy for foreign defined contribution plans is consistent with the local requirements in each country. Autodesk’s contributions to these plans were $29.6 million in fiscal 2019, $27.2 million in fiscal 2018, and $26.6 million in fiscal 2017.\n\nCash Balance Plans\n\nAutodesk provides a cash balance plan that insures the risks of disability, death, and longevity, in which the vested\n\npension capital is reinvested and provides a 100% capital and interest guarantee. The weighted-average guaranteed interest crediting rate for cash balance plans was 1.0%, 1.0%, and 1.3% for mandatory retirement savings and 0.3%, 0.3%, and 0.8% for supplementary retirement savings for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\n\nOther Plans\n\nIn addition, Autodesk offers a non-qualified deferred compensation plan to certain key employees whereby they may defer a portion (or all) of their annual compensation until retirement or a different date specified by the employee in accordance with terms of the plan. See Note 7, “Deferred Compensation,” for further discussion.\n\n16. Restructuring and other exit costs, net\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Board of Directors approved a world-wide restructuring plan (“Fiscal 2018 Plan”) to support the Company's strategic priorities of completing the subscription transition, digitizing the Company, and re-imagining manufacturing, construction, and production. Through the restructuring, Autodesk seeks to reduce its investments in areas not aligned with its strategic priorities, including in areas related to research and development and go-to-market activities. At the same time, Autodesk plans to further invest in strategic priority areas related to digital infrastructure, customer success, and construction. By re-balancing resources to better align with the Company’s strategic priorities, Autodesk is positioning itself to meet its long-term goals. This world-wide restructuring plan included a reduction in force of approximately 11% of the Company’s workforce, or 1,027 employees, and the consolidation of certain leased facilities. By January 31, 2019, the personnel and facilities related actions included in this restructuring plan were substantially complete.\n\nDuring Fiscal 2019, restructuring charges under the Fiscal 2018 Plan included $39.2 million in employee termination\n\nbenefits and $3.2 million in lease termination and other exit costs.\n\n2019 Form 10-K 104\n\n2017\n\n1.7% 2.6%\n\nThe following tables set forth the restructuring charges and other facility exit costs, net during the fiscal years ended\n\nJanuary 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\nBalances, January 31, 2018\n\nAdditions\n\nPayments\n\nAdjustments (1)\n\nBalances, January 31, 2019\n\nFiscal 2018 Plan\n\nEmployee terminations costs\n\n$\n\n53.0\n\n$\n\n39.2\n\n$\n\n(89.7) $\n\n(0.5) $\n\n2.0\n\nFacility terminations and other exit costs\n\n2.5\n\n3.2\n\n(5.7)\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n55.5\n\n$\n\n42.4\n\n$\n\n(95.4) $\n\n(0.4) $\n\n2.1\n\nCurrent portion (2)\n\n$\n\n55.5\n\n$\n\n2.1\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n55.5\n\n$\n\n2.1\n\n____________________ (1) Adjustments primarily relate to the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, settlement of lease contracts, and certain write offs related\n\n(2)\n\nto fixed assets.

Total revenue includes SPVSS business revenue of $168 million and $903 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\nInfrastructure Platforms consist of our core networking technologies of switching, routing, wireless, and data center products that are designed to work together to deliver networking capabilities and transport and/or store data. These technologies consist of both hardware and software offerings, including software licenses and software-as-a-service (SaaS), that help our customers build networks, automate, orchestrate, integrate, and digitize data. We are shifting and expanding more of our business to software and subscriptions across our core networking portfolio. Our hardware and perpetual software in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses are multiple performance obligations where the term license is recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.\n\nApplications consists of offerings that utilize the core networking and data center platforms to provide their functions. The products consist primarily of software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS, as well as hardware. Our perpetual software and hardware in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses are multiple performance obligations where the term license is recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.

These products consist of both hardware and software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS. Updates and upgrades for the term software licenses are critical for our software to perform its intended commercial purpose because of the continuous need for our software to secure our customers’ network environments against frequent threats. Therefore, security software licenses are generally represented by a single distinct performance obligation with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.\n\nOther Products primarily include our Service Provider Video Software Solutions and cloud and system management products. On October 28, 2018, we completed the sale of the SPVSS. These products include both hardware and software licenses. Our offerings in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control.\n\nIn addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service and support options for our customers, including technical support services and advanced services. Technical support services represent the majority of these offerings which are distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Advanced services are distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time with revenue recognized as services are delivered.\n\n72\n\nThe sales arrangements as discussed above are typically made pursuant to customer purchase orders based on master purchase or partner agreements. Cash is received based on our standard payment terms which is typically 30 days. We provide financing arrangements to customers for all of our hardware, software and service offerings.

When is the impairment of goodwill and tangible assets tested?,"['The following table summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the fiscal years ended January 31,\n\n2019 and 2018:\n\nJanuary 31, 2019\n\nJanuary 31, 2018\n\nGoodwill, beginning of the year\n\n$\n\n1,769.4\n\n$\n\n1,710.3\n\nLess: accumulated impairment losses, beginning of the year\n\n(149.2)\n\n(149.2)\n\nAdditions arising from acquisitions during the year\n\n866.9\n\n—\n\nEffect of foreign currency translation, measurement period adjustments, and other (1)\n\n(36.3)\n\n59.1\n\nGoodwill, end of the year\n\n$\n\n2,450.8\n\n$\n\n1,620.2\n\n_______________ (1) Purchase accounting adjustments reflect revisions made to the Company’s preliminary determination of estimated fair value of assets\n\nand liabilities assumed during fiscal 2019 and 2018.\n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nAt least annually or more frequently as circumstances dictate, Autodesk reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever impairment indicators exist. Autodesk continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate the carrying amounts of its long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, Autodesk assesses recoverability of these assets. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the carrying amounts of the assets to the future undiscounted cash flow the assets are expected to generate. If the long-lived assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. Autodesk did not recognize any material impairments of long-lived assets during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\n\nIn addition to the recoverability assessments, Autodesk routinely reviews the remaining estimated useful lives of its long-\n\nlived assets. Any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made, as well as in subsequent quarters.\n\nDeferred Tax Assets\n\nDeferred tax assets arise primarily from tax credits, net operating losses, and timing differences for reserves, accrued liabilities, stock options, deferred revenue, purchased technologies, and capitalized intangibles, partially offset by U.S. deferred tax liabilities on acquired intangibles, and valuation allowances against U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets. Autodesk performed a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets and believes it will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize the net deferred tax assets. They are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce gross deferred tax assets to the amount that is ""more likely than not"" to be realized.\n\nStock-based Compensation Expense\n\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, as\n\nfollows:\n\nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nCost of subscription and maintenance revenue\n\n$\n\n13.2\n\n$\n\n11.9\n\n$\n\n8.6\n\nCost of other revenue\n\n4.3\n\n4.0\n\n5.5\n\nMarketing and sales\n\n109.4\n\n107.3\n\n94.1\n\nResearch and development\n\n82.6\n\n82.9\n\n81.3\n\nGeneral and administrative\n\n40.0\n\n55.3\n\n32.3\n\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock awards and Employee Qualified\n\nStock Purchase Plan (""ESPP"") purchases\n\n249.5\n\n261.4\n\n221.8\n\nTax benefit\n\n(2.6)\n\n(2.6)\n\n(2.6)\n\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock awards and ESPP purchases,\n\nnet\n\n$\n\n246.9\n\n$\n\n258.8\n\n$\n\n219.2\n\n2019 Form 10-K 71\n\nt r o p e R\n\nl a u n n A 9 1 0 2\n\n2 0 1 9 A n n u a l\n\nR e p o r t\n\nAutodesk determines the grant date fair value of its share-based payment awards using a Black-Scholes Merton (""BSM"") option pricing model or the quoted stock price on the date of grant, unless the awards are subject to market conditions, in which case Autodesk uses a binomial-lattice model (e.g., Monte Carlo simulation model).

The expected volatility for performance stock units subject to market conditions includes the expected volatility of Autodesk\'s peer companies within the S&P Computer Software Select Index or S&P North American Technology Software Index with a market capitalization over $2.00 billion, depending on the award type.\n\nAutodesk estimates the expected life of stock-based awards using both exercise behavior and post-vesting termination\n\nbehavior as well as consideration of outstanding options. The range of expected lives of ESPP awards are based upon the four, six-month exercise periods within a 24-month offering period.\n\nAutodesk did not pay cash dividends in fiscal 2019, 2018, or 2017 and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in\n\nthe foreseeable future. Consequently, an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the BSM option pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation model.\n\nThe risk-free interest rate used in the BSM option pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation model for stock-based\n\nawards is the historical yield on U.S. Treasury securities with equivalent remaining lives.\n\nAutodesk recognizes expense only for the stock-based awards that ultimately vest. Autodesk accounts for forfeitures of\n\nstock-based awards as those forfeitures occur.\n\nAdvertising Expenses\n\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred.', 'Financial Statements\n\nStrategic ReportCorporate GovernanceAdditional InformationIntroduction\n\n2019 Annual Report and Accounts\n\n17 Impairment of Goodwill and Intangibles\n\nBefore recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows:\n\n31 March 2019 $M\n\n31 March 2018 $M\n\nAmericas\n\n273.6\n\n288.2\n\nEMEA\n\n413.0\n\n434.2\n\nAPJ\n\n98.7\n\n103.6\n\n785.3\n\n826.0\n\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets is tested annually, or more frequently where there is indication of impairment.\n\nWhere the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\nGoodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the cash-generating unit to which it relates is greater than the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use.\n\nFor the year-ended 31 March 2019, the Directors have reviewed the value of goodwill based on internal value in use calculations. The key assumptions for these calculations are discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to billings and direct costs during the period.\n\nThe Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the Directors’ most recent financial forecasts for the following five years. The growth rates for the five-year period are based on Directors’ expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the cash-generating unit, planned growth in market share, industry forecasts, growth in the market and specific regional considerations and are in line with past experience. Discount rates have been estimated based on rates that reflect current market assessments of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital.\n\nThe key assumptions used in the assessments in the year-ended 31 March 2019 are as follows:\n\nAmericas\n\nEMEA\n\nAPJ\n\nLong-term regional growth rate beyond five years\n\n2.5%\n\n1.5%\n\n2.0%\n\nDiscount rate\n\n9.0%\n\n9.0%\n\n10.0%\n\nThe key assumptions used in the assessments in the year-ended 31 March 2018 were as follows:\n\nAmericas\n\nEMEA\n\nAPJ\n\nLong-term regional growth rate beyond five years\n\n2.5%\n\n1.5%\n\n2.0%\n\nDiscount rate\n\n9.5%\n\n9.5%\n\n10.5%\n\nAs at 31 March 2019, there were no indicators of impairment that suggested the carrying amounts of the Group’s long-lived assets are not recoverable. In order to assess the sensitivity in the assumptions made, the Directors have flexed the discount rate upward by thirty per cent of the above rates, and noted that this still did not give any indication of impairment.\n\n153', 'The Company recorded $82.7 in goodwill and $85.0 of other identifiable intangibles in connection with the acquisitions.

Eligible compensation includes any compensation received by the employee during the year. The ESPP provides for semi-annual offering periods during which shares may be purchased and continues as long as shares remain available under the ESPP, unless terminated earlier at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Individual ESPP participants are restricted from purchasing more than $25,000 of common stock in one calendar year or 1,000 shares in an offering period.\n\nEmployees purchased approximately 1.0 million shares under the ESPP during each year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.

Annualized cost savings related to actions initiated in fiscal 2019 are expected to be approximately $220 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2021. Cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses.\n\nIn response to market weakness in fiscal 2019, we initiated incremental restructuring actions, primarily consisting of employee severance, to broaden the scope of our cost reduction initiatives and accelerate cost reduction and factory footprint consolidation activities.

Compensation and benefits expense decreased by\n\n$2.1 million in 2019, primarily due to reductions in headcount and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense, driven by employee turnover and the decline in our stock price. The decrease was further driven by the reduction in our provision for bad debts of $0.3 million in 2019, primarily due to improved efforts to collect on long outstanding and reserved receivables.

In 2019, there was a net benefit of $0.3 million from the reserve for uncertain foreign tax positions primarily due to the close of the statute of limitations on several such positions during the year. This compared to 2018, when there was a $0.4 million net expense related to the reserve for uncertain foreign tax positions.

The net increase in the total valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 is primarily related to the increase of a net operating loss carry forward due to a release of a non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefit and the increase of deferred tax assets in sites with existing valuation allowances. The decrease in domestic federal and state tax credits is primarily related to the utilization of tax credits against the one-time transition tax.\n\nAs of August 31, 2019, the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the remaining earnings from its foreign\n\nsubsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not already been recorded. The accumulated earnings are the most significant component of the basis difference which is indefinitely reinvested.', '(23)\n\nGross deferred tax liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n(6,508)\n\n(6,337)\n\nNet deferred tax liability . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $\n\n(2,780)\n\n(2,397)\n\nB-98', 'TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\n\nDeferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for\n\nfinancial reporting and tax purposes.

During fiscal 2019, tax loss and carryforwards increased primarily as a result of a $2,891 million (tax effected) net write-down of investments in subsidiaries in certain jurisdictions,\n\n65']",The table provides information for the long-term deferred tax assets and long-term deferred tax liabilities for the company for the fiscal years ended 2018 and 2019.,"2019, 2018",1.0,0.9999999999666667,0.9999999999666667,0.5,0.8549490659762617
What does the recorded investment include?,"['$800.0 million, cash dividends paid of $342.3 million, repayments of long-term debt of $242.3 million, and a net increase in short-term borrowings of $249.1 million.\n\nThe Company had cash and cash equivalents of $236.6 million at May 26, 2019 and $128.0 million at May 27, 2018, of which $144.8 million at May 26, 2019, and $121.6 million at May 27, 2018, was held in foreign countries. We believe that our foreign subsidiaries have invested or will invest any undistributed earnings indefinitely, or that any undistributed earnings will be remitted in a tax-neutral transaction, and, therefore, do not provide deferred taxes on the cumulative undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.\n\nOur preliminary estimate of capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 is approximately $400 million.\n\nManagement believes that existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, existing credit facilities, and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our repayment of debt, including any repayment of debt or refinancing of debt, working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months.\n\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\n\nWe use off-balance sheet arrangements (e.g., leases accounted for as operating leases) where sound business principles warrant their use. We also periodically enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. These are described further in ""Obligations and Commitments"" below.\n\nVariable Interest Entities Not Consolidated\n\nWe lease or leased certain office buildings from entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities. The lease agreements with these entities include fixed-price purchase options for the assets being leased. The lease agreements also contain contingent put options (the ""lease put options"") that allow or allowed the lessors to require us to purchase the buildings at the greater of original construction cost, or fair market value, without a lease agreement in place (the ""put price"") in certain limited circumstances. As a result of substantial impairment charges related to our divested Private Brands operations, these lease put options became exercisable. We are amortizing the difference between the put price and the estimated fair value (without a lease agreement in place) of the property over the remaining lease term within SG&A expenses. During fiscal 2018, we purchased two buildings that were subject to lease put options and recognized net losses totaling $48.2 million for the early exit of unfavorable lease contracts. During fiscal 2017, one of these lease agreements expired, and we reversed the applicable accrual and recognized a benefit of $6.7 million in SG&A expenses.\n\nAs of May 26, 2019 and May 27, 2018, there was one remaining leased building subject to a lease put option for which the put option price exceeded the estimated fair value of the property by $8.2 million, of which we had accrued $1.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively. This lease is accounted for as an operating lease, and accordingly, there are no material assets and liabilities, other than the accrued portion of the put price, associated with this entity included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of this entity. In making this determination, we have considered, among other items, the terms of the lease agreement, the expected remaining useful life of the asset leased, and the capital structure of the lessor entity.\n\nOBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS\n\nAs part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements, debt agreements, and unconditional purchase obligations (i.e., obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices, such as ""take-or-pay"" contracts). The unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in our normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available. Of these items, debt, notes payable, and capital lease obligations, which totaled $10.72 billion as of May 26, 2019, were recognized as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations, which totaled $1.75 billion as of May 26, 2019, were not recognized as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\n37\n\nA summary of our contractual obligations as of May 26, 2019, was as follows:\n\nPayments Due by Period (in millions)\n\nContractual Obligations Long-term debt . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Capital lease obligations . . . . . . . . . .\n\nTotal\n\n10,556.6\n\n165.4\n\n$\n\nLess than 1 Year\n\n— $\n\n20.6\n\n1-3 Years\n\n2,747.6\n\n41.0\n\n$\n\n3-5 Years\n\n2,287.0\n\n29.4\n\n$\n\nAfter 5 Years\n\n5,522.0\n\n74.4\n\nOperating lease obligations . . . . . . . .

Such agreements are generally settleable in the ordinary course of business in less than one year.\n\nWe are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our long-term debt and capital lease obligations. The weighted-\n\naverage coupon interest rate of the long-term debt obligations outstanding as of May 26, 2019, was approximately 4.7%.\n\nAs of May 26, 2019, we had aggregate unfunded pension and postretirement benefit obligations totaling $131.7 million and $87.8 million, respectively. These amounts are not included in the table above as the unfunded obligations are remeasured each fiscal year, thereby resulting in our inability to accurately predict the ultimate amount and timing of any future required contributions to such plans. Based on current statutory requirements, we are not obligated to fund any amount to our qualified pension plans during the next twelve months. We estimate that we will make payments of approximately $14.2 million and $10.8 million over the next twelve months to fund our pension and postretirement plans, respectively.', 'Supplementary Financial Data (Unaudited) (in millions, except per-share amounts)\n\nQuarters Ended Revenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Gross margin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Operating income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income per share - basic . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income per share - diluted . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Cash dividends declared per common share. . . . . . . . . . . $ Cash and cash equivalents and investments . . . . . . . . . . . $\n\nJuly 27, 2019 (1) April 27, 2019\n\n13,428 $ 8,574 $ 3,690 $ 2,206 $ 0.52 $ 0.51 $ 0.35 $ 33,413 $\n\n12,958 $ 8,173 $ 3,513 $ 3,044 $ 0.70 $ 0.69 $ 0.35 $ 34,643 $\n\nJanuary 26, 2019 12,446 7,773 3,211 2,822 0.63 0.63 0.33 40,383\n\nOctober 27, 2018 13,072 $ 8,146 $ 3,805 $ 3,549 $ 0.78 $ 0.77 $ 0.33 $ 42,593 $\n\nQuarters Ended Revenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Gross margin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Operating income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income (loss) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income (loss) per share - basic . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Net income (loss) per share - diluted. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Cash dividends declared per common share . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Cash and cash equivalents and investments . . . . . . . . . . . . . $\n\nJuly 28, 2018 (2)\n\n12,844 $ 7,922 $ 3,346 $ 3,803 $ 0.81 $ 0.81 $ 0.33 $ 46,548 $\n\nApril 28, 2018\n\n12,463 $ 7,759 $ 3,134 $ 2,691 $ 0.56 $ 0.56 $ 0.33 $ 54,431 $\n\nJanuary 27, 2018 (3) October 28, 2017 12,136 $ 11,887 7,427 $ 7,498 2,756 3,073 $ 2,394 (8,778) $ 0.48 (1.78) $ 0.48 (1.78) $ 0.29 $ 0.29 71,588 $ 73,683\n\n(1) In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we recorded an $872 million charge which was the reversal of the previously recorded benefit associated with the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends recorded in fiscal 2018 as a result of a retroactive final U.S. Treasury regulation issued during the quarter.\n\n(2) In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded adjustments to the provisional amounts related to the U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and re-measurement of net deferred tax assets.

What is the percentage change in BCE operating revenues in 2019?,"['n o i t a m r o f n\n\ni\n\ny l r e t r a u q d n a\n\nA & D M\n\na u n n a d e t c e e S\n\nl\n\n7\n\n86\n\nFOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS\n\nOPERATING REVENUES\n\nBell Wireless\n\nBell Wireline\n\nBell Media\n\nInter-segment eliminations\n\nTotal BCE operating revenues\n\nADJUSTED EBITDA\n\nBell Wireless\n\nBell Wireline\n\nBell Media\n\nTotal BCE adjusted EBITDA\n\nBCE operating revenues grew by 1.6% in Q4 2019, compared to Q4 2018, driven by growth in Bell Wireless and Bell Media, while Bell Wireline remained stable year over year. The year-over-year increase reflected both higher service and product revenues of 0.9% and 5.7%, respectively.\n\nBCE net earnings increased by 12.6% in Q4 2019, compared to Q4 2018, mainly due to higher adjusted EBITDA, lower other expense and lower severance, acquisition and other costs. This was partly offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense and finance costs. The adoption of IFRS 16 did not have a significant impact on net earnings.\n\nBCE adjusted EBITDA increased by 4.8% in Q4 2019, compared to Q4 2018, driven by growth across all three of our segments. This resulted in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 39.7% in the quarter, up 1.2 pts over Q4 2018, primarily due to the favourable impact from the adoption of IFRS 16 in 2019.\n\nBell Wireless operating revenues increased by 3.6% in Q4 2019, compared to Q4 2018, driven by higher service and product revenues. Service revenues grew by 1.6% year over year due to continued growth in both our postpaid and prepaid subscriber base along with rate increases and a greater mix of customers subscribing to higher-value monthly plans including unlimited data plans. This was moderated by greater sales of premium handsets along with the impact of higher- value monthly plans, and lower data overage driven by increased customer adoption of unlimited data plans. Product revenues grew by 7.4% year over year, driven by increased sales of premium handsets and the impact of higher-value monthly plans in our sales mix.\n\nBell Wireless adjusted EBITDA increased by 7.4% in Q4 2019, compared to the same period last year, mainly driven by the flow-through of higher revenues, partially offset by higher operating expenses of 1.4% year over year. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher product cost of goods sold from greater mix of premium handsets and increased handset costs, higher network operating costs to support the growth in our subscriber base and data consumption and higher bad debt expense driven by the growth in revenues. This was offset in part by the favourable impact from the adoption of IFRS 16 in 2019. Adjusted EBITDA margin, based on wireless operating revenues, of 37.9% increased by 1.4 pts over Q4 2018, mainly due to the impact from the adoption of IFRS 16, greater service revenue flow-through and promotional spending discipline during the holiday season, moderated by higher low-margin product sales in our total revenue base.\n\nBCE Inc. 2019 Annual Report\n\nQ4 2019\n\nQ4 2018\n\n$ CHANGE\n\n% CHANGE\n\n2,493\n\n2,407\n\n86\n\n3.6%\n\n3,138\n\n3,137\n\n1\n\n–\n\n879\n\n850\n\n29\n\n3.4%\n\n(194)\n\n(179)\n\n(15)\n\n(8.4%)\n\n6,316\n\n6,215\n\n101\n\n1.6%\n\nQ4 2019\n\nQ4 2018\n\n$ CHANGE\n\n% CHANGE\n\n944\n\n879\n\n65\n\n7.4%\n\n1,359\n\n1,339\n\n20\n\n1.5%\n\n205\n\n176\n\n29\n\n16.5%\n\n2,508\n\n2,394\n\n114\n\n4.8%\n\nBell Wireline operating revenues remained unchanged in Q4 2019, compared to Q4 2018, resulting from stable year-over-year service revenue which increased 0.1%, as the continued expansion of our retail Internet and IPTV subscriber bases, residential rate increases, contribution from the federal election and higher business solution services revenue were offset by ongoing subscriber erosion in voice and satellite TV, greater acquisition, retention and bundle discounts on residential services to match competitor promotions, lower TV pay-per-view revenues and a decline in IP connectivity revenues due in part to migration to Internet based services. Product revenues were relatively stable year over year, declining 0.6% or $1 million.\n\nBell Wireline adjusted EBITDA grew by 1.5% in Q4 2019, compared to Q4 2018, mainly due to lower operating costs of 1.1%, driven by the favourable impact from the adoption of IFRS 16 in 2019 and continued effective cost containment. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 0.6 pts to 43.3% in Q4 2019, compared to Q4 2018, mainly due to the favourable impact from the adoption of IFRS 16 in 2019.\n\nBell Media operating revenues increased by 3.4% in Q4 2019, compared to the same period last year, driven by increased subscriber revenues from the continued growth in Crave due to higher subscribers along with rate increases following the launch of our enhanced Crave service in November 2018 and also reflected the favourability from BDU contract renewals. Advertising revenues declined modestly in Q4 2019, compared to Q4 2018, from lower conventional TV advertising revenues and ongoing market softness in radio, partially offset by continued growth in specialty TV and OOH advertising revenues.\n\nBell Media adjusted EBITDA increased by 16.5% in Q4 2019, compared to the same period last year, driven by higher operating revenues coupled with stable operating expenses as the favourable impact from the adoption of IFRS 16 in 2019 was offset by the growth in programming and content costs related to higher sports broadcast rights costs and ongoing Crave content expansion.\n\nBCE capital expenditures of $1,153 million in Q4 2019 increased by $179 million over Q4 2018 and corresponded to a capital intensity ratio of 18.3% compared to 15.7% last year. The growth in capital investments was driven by increases across all three of our segments. Wireline capital spending was $96 million higher year over year, mainly due to the timing of our spending, driven by the roll-out of fixed WTTP to rural locations in Ontario and Québec.', 'Results of Operations\n\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of revenue for certain items in our statements of operations for the periods indicated:\n\n2019\n\nFiscal Years 2018\n\n2017\n\nStatements of Operations: Revenue Cost of revenue Gross profit Operating expenses:\n\n100 % 43 % 57 %\n\n100 % 50 % 50 %\n\nResearch and development Selling, general and administrative\n\nLoss from operations Interest expense Interest income and other expense, net Loss before income taxes Provision for income taxes Net loss\n\n120 % 86 % (149 )% (3 )% 2 % (150 )% 1 % (151 )%\n\n79 % 79 % (108 )% (1 )% 1 % (108 )% 1 % (109 )%\n\nImpact of inflation and product price changes on our revenue and on income was immaterial in 2019, 2018 and 2017.\n\nComparison of Fiscal Years 2019 and 2018\n\nRevenue.

What is the company's main cost of revenue?,"['Table of Contents\n\nrevenue consists of personnel costs for our technical support team. Our cost of services revenue primarily consists of personnel costs for our professional serviceemployees, third-party contractors, and travel-related costs. In instances where we have primary responsibility for the delivery of services, subcontractor fees areexpensed as cost of services revenue. In each case, personnel costs include salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation.We allocate overhead such as information technology support, information security, facilities, and other administrative costs to all functional departmentsbased on headcount. As such, these general overhead expenses are reflected in cost of revenue and each functional operating expense.Cost of Revenue: Fiscal years ended July 31, 2019 2018 Change Amount % of totalrevenue Amount % of totalrevenue ($) (%) (In thousands, except percentages)Cost of revenue: License and subscription$64,798 9% $35,452 5% 29,346 83Maintenance16,499 2 14,783 2 1,716 12Services243,053 34 246,548 38 (3,495) (1)Total cost of revenue$324,350 45% $296,783 45% 27,567 9 Includes stock-based compensation of: Cost of license and subscription revenue$3,011 $1,002 2,009 Cost of maintenance revenue1,820 1,886 (66) Cost of services revenue22,781 21,856 925 Total$27,612 $24,744 2,868 The $29.3 million increase in our cost of license and subscription revenue was primarily attributable to increases of $14.9 million in personnel expenses, $8.6million in cloud infrastructure costs incurred in order to support the growth of our subscription offerings, $3.3 million in royalties, $1.8 million in professionalservices, and $0.9 million related to the amortization of internal-use software development and acquired intangible assets. Cloud infrastructure costs include $9.5million of hosting related costs that were recorded in cost of services revenue in fiscal year 2018. The treatment of these hosting related costs is consistent with thetreatment of the related revenue in each fiscal year.We anticipate higher cost of license and subscription revenue as we continue to invest in our cloud operations to increase operational efficiency and scalewhile growing our customer base.Cost of maintenance revenue increased by $1.7 million primarily due to the increase in personnel required to support our term and perpetual licensecustomers.Our cost of services revenue would have increased if cloud infrastructure costs totaling $9.5 million were not reclassified to cost of license and subscriptionrevenue, consistent with the treatment of the related revenue.

Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products, taxes, interest payments and leased facilities.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased during fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to certain unfavorable cash changes in working capital balances, primarily unfavorable changes associated with income taxes including the first installment payment made pursuant to the transition tax provisions of the Tax Act during fiscal 2019 (see additional discussion of future installment payments pursuant to the Tax Act’s transition tax under “Contractual Obligations” below).\n\nCash flows from investing activities: The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to our acquisitions, the timing of our purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable debt securities and investments in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our growth.\n\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $26.6 billion during fiscal 2019 compared to $5.6 billion of net cash used for investing during fiscal 2018.

Therefore, the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in 2019 can be calculated as follows:
Net decrease = Net cash provided by operating activities + Net cash provided by investing activities - Net cash used for financing activities
Net decrease = $14,551 million + $26,557 million - $42,056 million
Net decrease = $-1,948 million

Interest income increased due to higher interest rates. Other expense in the year ended December 31, 2018, was driven by foreign currency translation losses mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro. Other income in the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven mainly by foreign currency translation gains due to the depreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro.\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nEffective tax rate\n\n19.9%\n\nThe effective income tax rate in 2018 was 19.9% compared to 64.1% in the prior year. The tax rate in 2018 was favorably impacted by a discrete one-time rate change benefit related to the Tax Act resulting from the election of tax accounting method changes, partially offset by a one-time withholding tax on repatriation of earnings from one of our foreign subsidiaries that was completed during the year to enable the use of tax credits due to expire in 2018. The tax rate in 2017 was unfavorably impacted by the application of the Tax Act, driven by the remeasurement of the net deferred tax assets from 35% to 21% and the one-time mandatory transition tax on the historical earnings of foreign affiliates, which resulted in a net non-cash charge of $18,001.\n\nNet earnings were $46,532 or $1.39 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to earnings of $14,448 or $0.43 per diluted share in the comparable period of 2017.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $100,241 at December 31, 2019, and $100,933 at December 31, 2018, of which $98,309 and $96,762, respectively, were held outside the United States. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $692 was primarily driven by cash generated from operating activities of $64,405 and net proceeds from an increase in borrowings of long-term debt of $49,700, which were offset by the payment for the QTI acquisition of $73,906, capital expenditures of $21,733, treasury stock purchases of $11,746, dividends paid of $5,238, and taxes paid on behalf of equity award participants of $2,657. Total debt as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, was $99,700 and $50,000, respectively. Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, defined as long-term debt as a percentage of total debt and shareholders’ equity, was 19.7% at December 31, 2019, compared to 11.7% at December 31, 2018.\n\nWorking capital increased by $5,164 from December 31, 2018, to December 31, 2019, driven mainly by the decrease in accrued payroll and benefits due to lower short-term incentive compensation and the decrease in accounts payable, which were partially offset by an increase in operating lease obligations.\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $64,405 during the year ended December 31, 2019. Components of net cash provided by operating activities included net earnings of $36,146, depreciation and amortization expense of $24,619, stock-based compensation of $5,015, other net non-cash items totaling $5,160, and a net cash outflow from changes in assets and liabilities of $6,535.\n\nCTS CORPORATION 21\n\n(3,343)\n\n1,284\n\n3,817\n\n1,758\n\n64.', ' . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Since these are short-term highly liquid investments with remaining\n\nmaturities of 3 months or less, they present negligible risk of changes in fair value due to changes in interest rates and are Level 1.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n\nOur foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency options, interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps are recorded at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets using a discounted cash flow analysis that incorporates observable market inputs. These market inputs include foreign currency spot and forward rates, and various interest rate curves, and are obtained from pricing data quoted by various banks, third-party sources and foreign currency dealers involving identical or comparable instruments and are Level 2.\n\nCounterparties to these foreign currency forward contracts have at least an investment grade rating. Credit ratings on\n\nsome of our counterparties may change during the term of our financial instruments. We closely monitor our counterparties’ credit ratings and, if necessary, will make any appropriate changes to our financial instruments. The fair value generally reflects the estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date.\n\nForeign currency forward contracts and options are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other\n\ncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\nOther Financial Instruments\n\nThe following financial instruments are recorded at fair value or at amounts that approximate fair value: (1) trade receivables, net, (2) certain other current assets, (3) accounts payable and (4) other current liabilities. The carrying amounts reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the above financial instruments closely approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.\n\nOther liabilities that are recorded at carrying value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets include our credit facilities and\n\nsenior notes. We utilize a market approach to calculate the fair value of our senior notes. Due to their limited investor base and the face value of some of our senior notes, they may not be actively traded on the date we calculate their fair value. Therefore, we may utilize prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving similar securities, reflecting U.S. Treasury yields to calculate the yield to maturity and the price on some of our senior notes.

We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, establishing credit limits, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk.\n\nWe do not expect any of our counterparties in derivative transactions to fail to perform as it is our policy to have counterparties to these contracts that have at least an investment grade rating. Nevertheless, there is a risk that our exposure to losses arising out of derivative contracts could be material if the counterparties to these agreements fail to perform their obligations. We will replace counterparties if a credit downgrade is deemed to increase our risk to unacceptable levels.\n\nWe regularly monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments.\n\nWe continually monitor the creditworthiness of our diverse base of customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business and generally do not require collateral. We consider the concentrations of credit risk associated with our trade accounts receivable to be commercially reasonable and believe that such concentrations do not leave us vulnerable to significant risks of near-term severe adverse impacts. The terms and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. Our sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers.\n\n']","The fair value of the derivative liabilities was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019.","2018, 2019",,0.9999999999666667,0.9999999999666667,1.0,0.9287766220635087

An important element of our international strategy is to develop\n\ncontent that is specifically directed toward local cultures and customs. Net revenues from international sales accounted for approximately 54%, 54%, and 55% of our total consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The majority of our net revenues from foreign countries are generated by consumers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business, including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changes in local economies. Accordingly, our future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in local economies.\n\nOperating Metrics\n\nThe following operating metrics are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business.

What happens if the shareholders fail to vote on an advisory basis in favor of the appointment?,"['ITEM NO. 2 – RATIFICATION OF KPMG AS OUR 2020 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR\n\nTHE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THIS PROPOSAL\n\nThe Audit Committee of the Board has appointed KPMG LLP as our independent auditor for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020, and we are submitting that appointment to our shareholders for ratification on an advisory basis at the meeting. Although shareholder ratification of KPMG’s appointment is not legally required, we are submitting this matter to the shareholders, as in the past, as a matter of good corporate practice. In determining whether to reappoint KPMG as our independent auditor, the Audit Committee considered a number of factors, including, among others, the firm’s qualifications, industry expertise, prior performance, control procedures, proposed staffing and the reasonableness of its fees on an absolute basis and as compared with fees paid by comparable companies.\n\nIf the shareholders fail to vote on an advisory basis in favor of the appointment, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether to retain KPMG, and may appoint that firm or another without resubmitting the matter to the shareholders. Even if the shareholders ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee may, in its discretion, select a different independent auditor at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the Company’s best interests.\n\nIn connection with the audit of the 2019 financial statements, we entered into an engagement letter with KPMG which sets forth the terms by which KPMG will provide audit services to us. Any future disputes between KPMG and us under that letter will be subject to certain specified alternative dispute resolution procedures, none of which are intended to restrict the remedies that our shareholders might independently pursue against KPMG.\n\nThe following table lists the aggregate fees and costs billed to us by KPMG and its affiliates for the 2018 and 2019 services identified below:\n\nAmount Billed\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nAudit Fees(1)\n\n$16,014,014 $17,639,702\n\nAudit-Related Fees(2)\n\n106,528\n\n153,203\n\nTax Fees(3)\n\n1,318,798\n\n119,098\n\nOther\n\n—\n\n—\n\nTotal Fees\n\n$17,439,340 $17,912,003\n\n(1)\n\nIncludes the cost of services rendered in connection with (i) auditing our annual consolidated financial statements, (ii) auditing our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (iii) reviewing our quarterly financial statements, (iv) auditing the financial statements of several of our subsidiaries, (v) reviewing our registration statements and issuing related comfort letters, (vi) statutory audits for certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and (vii) consultations regarding accounting standards.

We believe that our foreign subsidiaries have invested or will invest any undistributed earnings indefinitely, or that any undistributed earnings will be remitted in a tax-neutral transaction, and, therefore, do not provide deferred taxes on the cumulative undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.\n\nOur preliminary estimate of capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 is approximately $400 million.\n\nManagement believes that existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, existing credit facilities, and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our repayment of debt, including any repayment of debt or refinancing of debt, working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months.\n\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\n\nWe use off-balance sheet arrangements (e.g., leases accounted for as operating leases) where sound business principles warrant their use. We also periodically enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. These are described further in ""Obligations and Commitments"" below.\n\nVariable Interest Entities Not Consolidated\n\nWe lease or leased certain office buildings from entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities. The lease agreements with these entities include fixed-price purchase options for the assets being leased. The lease agreements also contain contingent put options (the ""lease put options"") that allow or allowed the lessors to require us to purchase the buildings at the greater of original construction cost, or fair market value, without a lease agreement in place (the ""put price"") in certain limited circumstances. As a result of substantial impairment charges related to our divested Private Brands operations, these lease put options became exercisable. We are amortizing the difference between the put price and the estimated fair value (without a lease agreement in place) of the property over the remaining lease term within SG&A expenses. During fiscal 2018, we purchased two buildings that were subject to lease put options and recognized net losses totaling $48.2 million for the early exit of unfavorable lease contracts. During fiscal 2017, one of these lease agreements expired, and we reversed the applicable accrual and recognized a benefit of $6.7 million in SG&A expenses.\n\nAs of May 26, 2019 and May 27, 2018, there was one remaining leased building subject to a lease put option for which the put option price exceeded the estimated fair value of the property by $8.2 million, of which we had accrued $1.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively. This lease is accounted for as an operating lease, and accordingly, there are no material assets and liabilities, other than the accrued portion of the put price, associated with this entity included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of this entity. In making this determination, we have considered, among other items, the terms of the lease agreement, the expected remaining useful life of the asset leased, and the capital structure of the lessor entity.\n\nOBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS\n\nAs part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements, debt agreements, and unconditional purchase obligations (i.e., obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices, such as ""take-or-pay"" contracts). The unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in our normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available. Of these items, debt, notes payable, and capital lease obligations, which totaled $10.72 billion as of May 26, 2019, were recognized as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations, which totaled $1.75 billion as of May 26, 2019, were not recognized as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\n37\n\nA summary of our contractual obligations as of May 26, 2019, was as follows:\n\nPayments Due by Period (in millions)\n\nContractual Obligations Long-term debt . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ Capital lease obligations . . . . . . . . . .\n\nTotal\n\n10,556.6\n\n165.4\n\n$\n\nLess than 1 Year\n\n— $\n\n20.6\n\n1-3 Years\n\n2,747.6\n\n41.0\n\n$\n\n3-5 Years\n\n2,287.0\n\n29.4\n\n$\n\nAfter 5 Years\n\n5,522.0\n\n74.4\n\nOperating lease obligations . . . . . . . .

Such agreements are generally settleable in the ordinary course of business in less than one year.\n\nWe are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our long-term debt and capital lease obligations. The weighted-\n\naverage coupon interest rate of the long-term debt obligations outstanding as of May 26, 2019, was approximately 4.7%.\n\nAs of May 26, 2019, we had aggregate unfunded pension and postretirement benefit obligations totaling $131.7 million and $87.8 million, respectively. These amounts are not included in the table above as the unfunded obligations are remeasured each fiscal year, thereby resulting in our inability to accurately predict the ultimate amount and timing of any future required contributions to such plans. Based on current statutory requirements, we are not obligated to fund any amount to our qualified pension plans during the next twelve months. We estimate that we will make payments of approximately $14.2 million and $10.8 million over the next twelve months to fund our pension and postretirement plans, respectively.', ' Deferred revenue was $18.5 billion as of July 27, 2019 compared to $19.7 billion as of July 28, 2018. In connection with the adoption of ASC 606, we recorded an adjustment to retained earnings to reduce deferred revenue by $2.8 billion. We recognized approximately $9.6 billion of revenue during fiscal 2019 that was included in the deferred revenue balance at July 29, 2018.\n\n(c) Remaining Performance Obligations\n\nRemaining Performance Obligations (RPO) are comprised of deferred revenue plus unbilled contract revenue. As of July 27, 2019, the aggregate amount of RPO was $25.3 billion, comprised of $18.5 billion of deferred revenue and $6.8 billion of unbilled contract revenue. We expect approximately 56% of this amount to be recognized as revenue over the next year. Unbilled contract revenue represents non-cancelable contracts for which we have not invoiced, have an obligation to perform, and revenue has not yet been recognized in the financial statements.\n\n(d) Capitalized Contract Acquisition Costs\n\nIn connection with the adoption of ASC 606, we began to capitalize direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire contracts, primarily sales commissions, for which the associated revenue is expected to be recognized in future periods. We incur these costs in connection with both initial contracts and renewals. These costs are initially deferred and typically amortized over the term of the customer contract which corresponds to the period of benefit. Deferred sales commissions were $750 million as of July 27, 2019, and was included in other current assets and other assets. The amortization expense associated with these costs was $471 million for fiscal 2019 and was included in sales and marketing expenses.\n\n4.

Revenue from the Luxtera acquisition has been included in our Infrastructure Platforms product category.\n\nThe total purchase consideration related to our acquisitions completed during fiscal 2019 consisted of cash consideration and vested share-based awards assumed. The total cash and cash equivalents acquired from these acquisitions was approximately $100 million.\n\n']","The deferred costs, specifically deferred sales commissions, are typically amortized over the term of the customer contract which corresponds to the period of benefit.

The Company adopted ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, using the alternative modified transition method with no restatement of prior periods or cumulative adjustment to retained earnings. Upon adoption, the Company elected the package of transition practical expedients: (i) not to reassess prior conclusions related to whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases; (ii) not to reassess the lease classification for any expired or existing leases; (iii) not to reassess initial direct costs for existing leases; and (iv) not to reassess certain land easements. Upon adoption of the standard effective January 1, 2019, the Company recognized an operating lease right-of-use assets of approximately $13.4 million and a corresponding operating lease liability of approximately $16.0 million, which included reclassifying existing deferred rent liability of $2.6 million to operating lease right-of-use assets.\n\nNote 2: Net Income Per Share\n\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per share is\n\ncomputed by adjusting the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares included in the diluted calculation consist of incremental shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options calculated using the treasury stock method.\n\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nNet income\n\n$\n\n4,155 $\n\n4,661\n\nWeighted average common shares—basic\n\n11,809\n\n12,323\n\nEffect of dilutive securities: stock options\n\n226\n\n187\n\nWeighted average common shares—diluted\n\n12,035\n\n12,510\n\nNet income per share—basic\n\n$\n\n0.35 $\n\n0.38\n\nNet income per share—diluted\n\n$\n\n0.35 $\n\n0.37\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, options to purchase 200,000 and 200,000 shares of common stock, respectively, were not included in the\n\ncomputation of diluted net income per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.\n\nNote 3: Balance Sheet Components\n\nPrepaid expenses and other consist of the following (in thousands):\n\nDecember 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nPrepaid expenses\n\n$\n\n2,303 $\n\nOther current assets\n\n193\n\nTotal prepaid expenses and other\n\n$\n\n2,496 $\n\n63\n\n1,780\n\n167\n\n1,947', '6']","The company adopted ASC 606 on March 1, 2018.","January 1, 2018",0.0,,,,

Cash flows provided by operating activities were $115.3 million for fiscal 2019, as compared to $66.8 million for fiscal 2018.

As necessary, we fund any incremental amounts for our estimated collection and recycling obligations on an annual basis based on the estimated costs of collecting and recycling covered modules, estimated rates of return on our restricted investments, and an estimated solar module life of 25 years less amounts already funded in prior years. To ensure that amounts previously funded will be available in the future regardless of potential adverse changes in our financial condition (even in the case of our own insolvency), we have established a trust under which estimated funds are put into custodial accounts with an established and reputable bank, for which First Solar, Inc.; First Solar Malaysia Sdn. Bhd.; and First Solar Manufacturing GmbH are grantors. Trust funds may be disbursed for qualified module collection and recycling costs (including capital and facility related recycling costs), payments to customers for assuming collection and recycling obligations, and reimbursements of any overfunded amounts. Investments in the trust must meet certain investment quality criteria comparable to highly rated government or agency bonds.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold certain restricted investments for proceeds of $281.6 million and realized gains of $40.6 million on such sales as part of efforts to align the currencies of the investments with those of the corresponding collection and recycling liabilities and disburse $22.2 million of overfunded amounts. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold certain restricted investments for proceeds of $231.1 million and realized gains of $55.4 million on such sales as part of an effort to align the currencies of the investments with those corresponding collection and recycling liabilities and disburse $143.1 million of overfunded amounts.

Credit Facility\n\nIn November 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the ‘‘2016 Credit Facility’’) with Silicon Valley Bank (‘‘SVB’’) as the lender. The 2016 Credit Facility provided a three-year, $25.0 million revolving credit facility, which included a maximum of $25.0 million letter of credit subfacility. Loan advances under the revolving facility were available of up to the full $25.0 million when the balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities minus outstanding revolving loans and letters of credit equaled or exceeded $50.0 million. If our net cash fell below $50.0 million, loan advances were determined based on a borrowing base equal to a specified percentage of the value of our eligible accounts receivable. Loans bore interest, at our option, at (i) the prime rate reported in The Wall Street Journal, minus 0.50% or (ii) a LIBOR rate determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility, plus 2.50%. Over the term of the 2016 Credit Facility, we paid customary closing fees, commitment fees and letter of credit fees for a facility of this size and type.\n\nIn September 2018, we entered into an amendment with SVB to reduce the unused revolving credit facility fee\n\non the 2016 Credit Facility from 0.4% to 0.3%.\n\nOur obligations under the 2016 Credit Facility were secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property. The 2016 Credit Facility required us to maintain compliance with customary affirmative and negative covenants, including compliance with an adjusted quick ratio of not less than 1.50:1.00, as determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility and restricted our ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions on our capital stock.\n\nOn November 1, 2019, the maturity date, we elected to allow the 2016 Credit Facility to expire without renewal. There were no outstanding loans or advances as of the maturity date. We currently have no plans for entering into a new borrowing facility.\n\n', 'COHERENT, INC.

Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, consisting of net loss of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $26.2 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $16.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $10.0 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an outflow from the changes in accrued liabilities and other of $5.9 million and inventory of $5.6 million, partially offset by an inflow from changes in deferred revenue of $3.2 million.\n\nThe unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and other was driven by an increase in lease liabilities associated with the lease of the San Jose corporate office. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to build up of inventory and timing of shipments, partially offset by increased reserves. The favorable change in deferred revenues was primarily driven by increased bookings.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million, consisting of net loss of $27.6 million which includes payments for our internal investigation costs of $8.6 million, non-cash charges of $25.0 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.9 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $3.1 million, offset primarily by an outflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $6.1 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and inventory of $1.5 million.\n\nThe favorable change in deferred revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the sale of subscription and support. The favorable change in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, increased value added tax accrual due to timing of payments, and an increase in legal fees accrual. The unfavorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections. The unfavorable change in prepaid and other assets was mainly driven by the increase in deferred sales commissions due to higher deferred revenue and higher average commission rate. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to the timing of shipments.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $14.3 million, consisting of a net loss of $10.8 million, a cash decrease resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million and non-cash charges of $26.4 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $17.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance of $1.1 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $12.4 million and deferred revenue of $3.0 million, and an outflow from the change in accrued liabilities of $8.9 million, inventory of $4.7 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and accounts payable of $0.9 million.\n\n', 'Table of Contents\n\nFree Cash Flow (non-U.S. GAAP measure). We also present Free Cash Flow, which is a non-U.S. GAAP measure, defined as (i) net cash from operating activities plus (ii) net cash used in investing activities, excluding payment for purchases (and proceeds from the sale) of marketable securities, and net cash variation for joint ventures deconsolidation, which are considered as temporary financial investments. The result of this definition is ultimately net cash from operating activities plus payment for purchase and proceeds from sale of tangible, intangible and financial assets, proceeds received in the sale of businesses and cash paid for business acquisitions. We believe Free Cash Flow, a non-U.S. GAAP measure, provides useful information for investors and management because it measures our capacity to generate cash from our operating and investing activities to sustain our operations. Free Cash Flow is not a U.S. GAAP measure and does not represent total cash flow since it does not include the cash flows generated by or used in financing activities. Free Cash Flow reconciles with the total cash flow and the net cash increase (decrease) by including the payment for purchases (and proceeds from the sale) of marketable securities and net cash variation from joint ventures deconsolidation, the net cash from (used in) financing activities and the effect of changes in exchange rates. In addition, our definition of Free Cash Flow may differ from definitions used by other companies.

Additionally, our cash flow generation ability is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs. Further, our capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned if, for example, our revenues do not reach expected levels, or we have to incur unforeseen capital expenditures and make investments to maintain our competitive position. If this is the case, we may seek alternative financing, such as selling additional debt or equity securities, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on favorable terms, if at all. Moreover, if we issue new debt securities, the debt holders would have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. If we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities, existing stockholders may experience dilution, and such new securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms and conditions of additional financings unattractive. Our inability to raise capital could impede our growth or otherwise require us to forego growth opportunities and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our working capital:\n\nFor the Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n(Dollars in thousands)\n\nCash and cash equivalents Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts Inventories, net Prepaid expenses Other current assets Accounts payable Accrued expenses Current operating lease liabilities Total Working Capital\n\n9,472 18,581 12,542 3,276 10,453 (18,668) (22,133) (1,185) 12,338 $\n\n$\n\nWorking Capital consists of current assets net of current liabilities. Working capital decreased $0.4 million to $12.3 million at December 31, 2019 compared with $12.7 million at December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily a result of an increase of cash, accounts receivable, and inventory offset by an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and current operating lease liabilities.\n\nWe normally carry three to four weeks of finished goods inventory. The average duration of our accounts receivable is approximately 25 days.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 our capital resources consisted of primarily $9.5 million cash on hand and $33.0 million available under our credit facilities, net of $2.0 million reserved for two letters of credit. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our capital resources consisted primarily of $7.5 million cash on hand and $30.0 million available under our credit facilities. The Credit Facilities will mature in May 2024.\n\nWe borrowed $72.3 million under our credit facilities during 2019, of which $18.5 million was repaid prior to the end of the year. As of December 31, 2019, we had $54.5 million of debt outstanding (including $0.7 million of debt issuance costs) under our credit facilities.

Volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was flat in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior-year period. This result reflected merchandising changes and price elasticity-related declines in certain brands, as well as isolated production challenges, partially offset by the continued benefit from momentum and innovation successes in the snacks businesses. Price/ mix was flat compared to the prior year as unfavorable mix, coupled with increases in brand building investments with retailers were offset by the impact of higher pricing. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC, which was completed in October 2017, contributed $41.3 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 results included $115.9 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $156.4 million of net sales related to this divested business.\n\nRefrigerated & Frozen net sales for fiscal 2019 were $2.80 billion, an increase of $51.0 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 1% increase in volume compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales volumes was a result of innovation across multiple brands, which was partially offset by the effects of reduced merchandising spend and the impact of a recall during the fourth quarter. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2018, as continued delivery of top-line accretive innovation in several brands was partially offset by brand building investments with retailers. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business, which was completed in February 2018, contributed $25.7 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition.\n\nInternational net sales for fiscal 2019 were $793.4 million, a decrease of $50.1 million, or 6%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 2% increase in volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, a 4% decrease due to foreign exchange rates, and a 2% increase in price/mix, in each case compared to fiscal 2018. The volume and price/ mix increases for fiscal 2019 were driven by growth in the Canadian snacks and frozen businesses. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $3.7 million to International net sales for fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 included $4.1 million of net sales related to our Del Monte® processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada, which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $48.9 million of net sales related to this divested business. In addition, fiscal 2019 and 2018 results included $17.1 million and $24.5 million, respectively, related to our divested Wesson® oil business.\n\nFoodservice net sales for fiscal 2019 were $934.2 million, a decrease of $120.6 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 14% decrease in volume, excluding divestitures. The decline in volume reflected the continued execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy and the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Price/mix increased 5% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in price/mix for fiscal 2019 reflected favorable product and customer mix, the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing, and the execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy. Fiscal 2019 included $34.2 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $53.4 million of net sales related to this divested business. Net sales declined by approximately 7% in fiscal 2019 due to the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility.\n\nPinnacle Foods net sales for fiscal 2019 (reflecting 213 days of Conagra Brands ownership) were $1.73 billion.

Interest income increased due to higher interest rates. Other expense in the year ended December 31, 2018, was driven by foreign currency translation losses mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro. Other income in the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven mainly by foreign currency translation gains due to the depreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro.\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nEffective tax rate\n\n19.9%\n\nThe effective income tax rate in 2018 was 19.9% compared to 64.1% in the prior year. The tax rate in 2018 was favorably impacted by a discrete one-time rate change benefit related to the Tax Act resulting from the election of tax accounting method changes, partially offset by a one-time withholding tax on repatriation of earnings from one of our foreign subsidiaries that was completed during the year to enable the use of tax credits due to expire in 2018. The tax rate in 2017 was unfavorably impacted by the application of the Tax Act, driven by the remeasurement of the net deferred tax assets from 35% to 21% and the one-time mandatory transition tax on the historical earnings of foreign affiliates, which resulted in a net non-cash charge of $18,001.\n\nNet earnings were $46,532 or $1.39 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to earnings of $14,448 or $0.43 per diluted share in the comparable period of 2017.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $100,241 at December 31, 2019, and $100,933 at December 31, 2018, of which $98,309 and $96,762, respectively, were held outside the United States. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $692 was primarily driven by cash generated from operating activities of $64,405 and net proceeds from an increase in borrowings of long-term debt of $49,700, which were offset by the payment for the QTI acquisition of $73,906, capital expenditures of $21,733, treasury stock purchases of $11,746, dividends paid of $5,238, and taxes paid on behalf of equity award participants of $2,657. Total debt as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, was $99,700 and $50,000, respectively. Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, defined as long-term debt as a percentage of total debt and shareholders’ equity, was 19.7% at December 31, 2019, compared to 11.7% at December 31, 2018.\n\nWorking capital increased by $5,164 from December 31, 2018, to December 31, 2019, driven mainly by the decrease in accrued payroll and benefits due to lower short-term incentive compensation and the decrease in accounts payable, which were partially offset by an increase in operating lease obligations.\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $64,405 during the year ended December 31, 2019. Components of net cash provided by operating activities included net earnings of $36,146, depreciation and amortization expense of $24,619, stock-based compensation of $5,015, other net non-cash items totaling $5,160, and a net cash outflow from changes in assets and liabilities of $6,535.\n\nCTS CORPORATION 21\n\n(3,343)\n\n1,284\n\n3,817\n\n1,758\n\n64.', 'A reconciliation of the beginning and ending liability for the year ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 is shown below.\n\nFiscal 2017 Restructuring Plan Balance payable as at June 30, 2017 Accruals and adjustments Cash payments Foreign exchange and other non-cash adjustments Balance payable as at June 30, 2018 Accruals and adjustments Cash payments Foreign exchange and other non-cash adjustments Balance payable as at June 30, 2019\n\n$\n\n$\n\nWorkforce reduction\n\n10,045 3,432 (12,342) 455 1,590 (254) (213) (77) 1,046\n\n$\n\n$\n\nFacility costs\n\n1,369 3,775 (1,627) (86) 3,431 1,152 (1,290) (344) 2,949\n\n$\n\n$\n\n$\n\n$\n\n$\n\nAcquisition-related costs\n\nIncluded within ""Special charges (recoveries)"" for the year ended June 30, 2019 are costs incurred directly in relation to acquisitions in the amount of $5.6 million (year ended June 30, 2018 and 2017—$4.8 million and $15.9 million, respectively).\n\nOther charges (recoveries)\n\nFor the year ended June 30, 2019, ""Other charges"" include (i) $1.1 million relating to one-time system implementation costs and (ii) $1.4 million relating to miscellaneous other charges.

The $111.8 million increase consisted of a $72.8 million increase in Ceramic product line sales and a $39.0 million increase in Tantalum product line sales. Also contributing to the increase in net sales was a $30.6 million increase in OEM sales across the APAC, EMEA, and JPKO regions, and a $28.0 million increase in EMS sales across all regions. These increases in net sales were partially offset by a $3.2 million decrease in distributor sales in the JPKO region and a $2.7 million decrease in OEM sales in the Americas region. In addition, Solid Capacitors net sales was unfavorably impacted by $0.5 million from foreign currency exchange due to the change in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe increase in Film and Electrolytic net sales was primarily driven by a $10.5 million increase in distributor sales\n\nacross the Americas and EMEA regions. Also contributing to the increase in net sales was $1.7 million increase in EMS sales in the Americas region and a $0.8 million increase in OEM sales in the JPKO region. These increases in net sales were partially offset by a $5.6 million decrease in OEM sales across the APAC and EMEA regions and a $3.1 million decrease in distributor sales across the APAC and JPKO regions.

This includes about a 1 point impact from businesses divested in 2019, and January 17, 2020 expectations for currency translation. This also includes an expectation of an improving trend in GTS, predominantly in the second half of 2020. We also expect to expand GAAP and operating (non-GAAP) gross margins and pre-tax income will include impacts from significant structural actions in 2020, primarily in our GTS business as we shift toward a more asset-based model to create a more competitive, flexible structure.\n\nFor full-year 2020, we expect the GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 3 to 6 percent, including an estimate for potential discrete tax events (discretes). We expect the operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for 2020 to be approximately 7 to 9 percent, including an estimate of potential discretes. We expect a discrete tax benefit in the first quarter of 2020. Together with the expected structural actions described above, we anticipate that these two items will be approximately neutral to the first- quarter and full-year 2020 earnings per share. Discretes by their nature are difficult to estimate and the actual impacts will be recorded as the discrete events occur. The rates will change year to year based on discrete tax events, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors including the geographic mix of income before taxes, state and local taxes and the effects of various global income tax strategies. The GAAP effective tax rate could also be affected by adjustments to the previously recorded charges for U.S. tax reform attributable to any changes in law, new regulations and guidance, audit adjustments, among others.\n\nAt constant currency, we expect accelerated growth of about 0.5 points from the fourth-quarter 2019 revenue growth rates to first-quarter 2020. At January 17, 2020 spot rates, we expect currency to be a headwind to first-quarter revenue growth of about 1.0 to 1.5 points, as compared to a headwind of 0.6 points in the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\nConsistent with the acquisition of a highly profitable software business, non-cash purchase accounting adjustments resulted in the Red Hat acquisition being dilutive to full-year 2019 earnings per share. In an acquisition, U.S. GAAP requires a company to record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair value. This includes the acquired deferred revenue balance. This resulted in a non-cash adjustment of $2.2 billion to the acquired deferred revenue balance and resulted in a reduction to reported revenue post-closing. The level of adjustment reflects the high margin profile of Red Hat’s subscription-based business. While there will be continued impact in 2020 from the deferred revenue adjustment from the Red Hat purchase accounting, it will largely be in the first half and lessen throughout the year.\n\nOverall, we expect GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations for 2020 to be at least $10.57. Excluding acquisition-related charges of $1.70 per share, non-operating retirement-related items of $1.02 per share and tax reform enactment impacts of $0.06 per share, operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share is expected to be at least $13.35. For the first quarter of 2020, we expect GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations to be 12 to 13 percent of the full-year expectation and operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share to be approximately 14 to 15 percent of the respective full-year expectation. This reflects typical seasonality of IBM’s operations, and the impact of the Red Hat deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustment.\n\nWe expect free cash flow to be approximately $12.5 billion in 2020. This includes contribution from Red Hat combined with incremental software and services synergy profits and net of incremental interest to finance the transaction and other acquisition-related charges. Free cash flow expectations reflect expected operational profit performance, partially offset by headwinds in capital expenditures and cash tax.\n\nThe Red Hat acquisition was funded through a combination of cash and debt, with the incremental debt issued in the first half of 2019. We will continue with a disciplined financial policy and are committed to maintaining strong investment-grade credit ratings. Since the end of the second quarter of 2019, we reduced our debt balance by $10.1 billion. We are continuing to target a leverage profile consistent with a mid to high single A credit rating within a couple years, while maintaining our solid and growing dividend. We suspended our share repurchase program at the close of the acquisition to direct our free cash flow towards reducing debt levels. The combination of these actions provides us with the flexibility to invest in the business going forward.\n\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2019 and continuing throughout the year, IBM’s Global Financing business wound down the portion of its commercial financing operations which provides short-term working capital solutions for OEM information technology suppliers, distributors and resellers. This was consistent with our capital allocation strategy and high-value focus. IBM Global Financing will continue to provide differentiated end-to-end financing solutions, including commercial financing in support of IBM partner relationships.\n\nWe expect 2020 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $2.7 billion, an increase of approximately $600 million compared to 2019. This estimate reflects current pension plan assumptions at December 31, 2019. Within total retirement-related plan cost, operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion, approximately flat versus 2019. Non-operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.2 billion, an increase of approximately $600 million compared to 2019, primarily driven by lower income from expected return on assets. Contributions for all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.3 billion in 2020, an increase of approximately $100 million compared to 2019.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources The company has consistently generated strong cash flow from operations, providing a source of funds ranging between $14.8 billion and $16.7 billion per year over the past three years. The company provides for additional liquidity through several sources: maintaining an adequate cash balance, access to\n\n57\n\n58\n\nglobal funding sources, committed global credit facilities and other committed and uncommitted lines of credit worldwide. The following table provides a summary of the major sources of liquidity for the years ended December 31, 2017 through 2019.\n\nThe major ratings agencies ratings on our debt securities at December 31, 2019 were as follows:\n\nIBM and IBM Credit Ratings\n\nStandard and Poor’s\n\nMoody’s Investors Service\n\nCash Flow and Liquidity Trends\n\nSenior long-term debt\n\nA\n\nA2\n\n($ in billions)\n\nCommercial paper\n\nA-1\n\nPrime-1\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nNet cash from\n\n']","For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Asia Pacific segment reported a negative impact of approximately $136,000 due to foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar.

What is the company paid on a cost-plus type contract?,"['We only include amounts representing contract change orders, claims or other items in the contract value when we believe the rights and obligations become enforceable. Contract modifications routinely occur to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. In most cases, contract modifications are for goods or services that are not distinct and, therefore, are accounted for as part of the existing contract. Transaction price estimates include additional consideration for submitted contract modifications or claims when we believe there is an enforceable right to the modification or claim, the amount can be reliably estimated, and its realization is reasonably assured. Amounts representing modifications accounted for as part of the existing contract are included in the transaction price and recognized as an adjustment to sales on a cumulative catch-up basis.\n\nIn addition, we are subject to audits of incurred costs related to many of our U.S. government contracts. These audits could produce different results than we have estimated for revenue recognized on our cost-based contracts with the U.S. government; however, our experience has been that our costs are acceptable to the government.\n\nContract Estimates\n\nUse of the cost-to-cost or other similar methods of revenue recognition requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the revenue and cost associated with the design, manufacture and delivery of our products and services. Revisions or adjustments to estimates of the transaction price, estimated costs at completion and estimated profit or loss of a performance obligation are often required as work progresses under a contract, as experience is gained, as facts and circumstances change and as new information is obtained, even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change. In determining the estimated costs at completion, we have to make assumptions regarding labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, estimated increases in wages and prices for materials, performance by our subcontractors, and the availability and timing of funding from our customer, among other variables. Revisions or adjustments to our estimated transaction price and estimated costs at completion may also be required if contract modifications occur. The revisions in contract estimates, if significant, can materially affect our results of operations and cash flows, and in some cases result in liabilities to complete contracts in a loss position. Based upon our history, we believe we have the ability to make reasonable estimates for these items. We have accounting policies and controls in place to address these, as well as other contractual and business arrangements to properly account for long-term contracts, and we continue to monitor and improve such policies, controls, and arrangements. For other information on such policies, controls and arrangements, see our discussion in Item 9A of this Form 10-K.\n\nProducts and services provided under long-term, fixed-price contracts represented approximately 97% of our sales for 2019. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if our underlying circumstances were to change. For example, if underlying assumptions were to change such that our estimated profit rate at completion for all fixed-price contracts accounted for under the cost-to-cost percentage-of-completion method was higher or lower by one percentage point, our 2019 operating income would have increased or decreased by approximately $6.5 million. When adjustments in estimated contract revenues or estimated costs at completion are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized by recording adjustments in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of the changes on current and prior periods using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period the loss is determined.\n\nThe aggregate impact of net changes in contract estimates are presented in the table below (amounts in thousands).\n\nOperating income (loss) Net income (loss) from continuing operations Diluted earnings per share\n\nYears Ended September 30, 2018\n\n2019\n\n$ (2,235) $ (6,986) $ (5,146) (0.19)\n\n(2,351) (0.08)\n\n2017 5,737 3,208 0.12\n\n', 'The following tables set forth the restructuring charges and other facility exit costs, net during the fiscal years ended\n\nJanuary 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\nBalances, January 31, 2018\n\nAdditions\n\nPayments\n\nAdjustments (1)\n\nBalances, January 31, 2019\n\nFiscal 2018 Plan\n\nEmployee terminations costs\n\n$\n\n53.0\n\n$\n\n39.2\n\n$\n\n(89.7) $\n\n(0.5) $\n\n2.0\n\nFacility terminations and other exit costs\n\n2.5\n\n3.2\n\n(5.7)\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n55.5\n\n$\n\n42.4\n\n$\n\n(95.4) $\n\n(0.4) $\n\n2.1\n\nCurrent portion (2)\n\n$\n\n55.5\n\n$\n\n2.1\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n55.5\n\n$\n\n2.1\n\n____________________ (1) Adjustments primarily relate to the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, settlement of lease contracts, and certain write offs related\n\n(2)\n\nto fixed assets.

Determining whether the products and/or services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment.\n\nThe Company’s SaaS and PaaS arrangements may include variable consideration in the form of usage-based fees. If the arrangement that includes variable consideration in the form of usage-based fees does not meet the allocation exception for variable consideration, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration at the outset of the arrangement using either the expected value or most likely amount method, depending on the specifics of each arrangement. These estimates are constrained to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of incremental revenue will not occur and are updated each reporting period as additional information becomes available.\n\nJudgment is used in determining: (1) whether the financing component in a software license agreement is significant and, if so, (2) the discount rate used in calculating the significant financing component. The Company assesses the significance of the financing component based on the ratio of license fees paid over time to total license fees. If determined to be significant, the financing component is calculated using a rate that discounts the license fees to the cash selling price.\n\nJudgment is also used in assessing whether the extension of payment terms in a software license arrangement results in variable consideration and, if so, the amount to be included in the transaction price. The Company applies the portfolio approach to estimating the amount of variable consideration in these arrangements using the most likely amount method that is based on the Company’s historical collection experience under similar arrangements.\n\nSignificant judgment is required to determine the SSP for each performance obligation, the amount allocated to each performance obligation and whether it depicts the amount that the Company expects to receive in exchange for the related product and/or service. As the selling prices of the Company’s software licenses are highly variable, the Company estimates SSP of its software licenses using the residual approach when the software license is sold with other services and observable SSPs exist for the other services. The Company uses a range of amounts to estimate SSP for maintenance and services. These ranges are based on stand-alone sales and vary based on the type of service and geographic region. If the SSP of a performance obligation is not directly observable, the Company will maximize observable inputs to determine its SSP.\n\nContract Balances\n\nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. The Company records an accrued receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing and the Company’s right to consideration only requires the passage of time, or deferred revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing.\n\nTotal receivables represent amounts billed and amounts earned that are to be billed in the future (i.e., accrued receivables). Included in accrued receivables are services and SaaS and PaaS revenues earned in the current period but billed in the following period and amounts due under multi-year software license arrangements with extended payment terms for which the Company has an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment subsequent to invoicing.\n\nTotal receivables, net is comprised of the following (in thousands):\n\nDecember 31,\n\nBilled receivables Allowance for doubtful accounts\n\nBilled receivables, net\n\nAccrued receivables Significant financing component\n\nTotal accrued receivables, net Less: current accrued receivables Less: current significant financing component\n\nTotal long-term accrued receivables, net\n\n$\n\n2019 213,654 $ (5,149 ) 208,505 399,302 (35,569 ) 363,733 161,714 (11,022 ) 213,041 572,238 $\n\n2018 239,275 (3,912 ) 235,363 336,858 (35,029 ) 301,829 123,053 (10,234 ) 189,010 537,192\n\nTotal receivables, net\n\n$\n\nNo customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated receivables balance as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\n']","Based on the information provided, the company's revenue recognition is primarily based on long-term, fixed-price contracts which represented approximately 97% of their sales in 2019.

Net revenues from international sales accounted for approximately 54%, 54%, and 55% of our total consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The majority of our net revenues from foreign countries are generated by consumers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business, including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changes in local economies. Accordingly, our future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in local economies.\n\nOperating Metrics\n\nThe following operating metrics are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business. The key drivers of\n\nchanges in our operating metrics are presented in the order of significance.\n\nNet bookings and In-game net bookings\n\nWe monitor net bookings as a key operating metric in evaluating the performance of our business because it enables an analysis of performance based on the timing of actual transactions with our customers and provides more timely indication of trends in our operating results. Net bookings is the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period, and includes license fees, merchandise, and publisher incentives, among others.

Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, consisting of net loss of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $26.2 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $16.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $10.0 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an outflow from the changes in accrued liabilities and other of $5.9 million and inventory of $5.6 million, partially offset by an inflow from changes in deferred revenue of $3.2 million.\n\nThe unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and other was driven by an increase in lease liabilities associated with the lease of the San Jose corporate office. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to build up of inventory and timing of shipments, partially offset by increased reserves. The favorable change in deferred revenues was primarily driven by increased bookings.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million, consisting of net loss of $27.6 million which includes payments for our internal investigation costs of $8.6 million, non-cash charges of $25.0 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.9 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $3.1 million, offset primarily by an outflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $6.1 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and inventory of $1.5 million.\n\nThe favorable change in deferred revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the sale of subscription and support. The favorable change in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, increased value added tax accrual due to timing of payments, and an increase in legal fees accrual. The unfavorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections. The unfavorable change in prepaid and other assets was mainly driven by the increase in deferred sales commissions due to higher deferred revenue and higher average commission rate. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to the timing of shipments.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $14.3 million, consisting of a net loss of $10.8 million, a cash decrease resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million and non-cash charges of $26.4 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $17.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance of $1.1 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $12.4 million and deferred revenue of $3.0 million, and an outflow from the change in accrued liabilities of $8.9 million, inventory of $4.7 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and accounts payable of $0.9 million.\n\n', '/2019AnnualReport', 'Segment Information\n\nAsia Pacific\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nRevenues\n\n$\n\n(In thousands) $\n\n6,490\n\n(Loss) from operations\n\n$\n\n(7,488)\n\n$\n\n(Loss) from operations as a % of revenues\n\n(115)%\n\nAsia Pacific net revenues decreased $1.4 million in 2019 compared to 2018 (see “Revenues” above).
