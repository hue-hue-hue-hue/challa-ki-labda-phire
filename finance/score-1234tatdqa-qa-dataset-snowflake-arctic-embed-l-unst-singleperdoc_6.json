by between 2018 and 2019?"},"retrieved_contexts":{"0":["General and administrative expenses in 2019 decreased by $2.7 million, or 20%, as compared to 2018.Compensation and benefits expense decreased by $2.1 million in 2019, primarily due to reductions in headcount and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense, driven by employee turnover and the decline in our stock price.The decrease was further driven by the reduction in our provision for bad debts of $0.3 million in 2019, primarily due to improved efforts to collect on long outstanding and reserved receivables.We also did not incur restructuring costs in 2019, as compared to 2018 when $0.2 million was incurred as part of the 2018 Restructuring Plan (refer to Note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements).\n\n##

%               |\n\nThe benefit from income taxes in 2019 totaled $0.1 million, as compared to a provision for income taxes of $0.6 million in 2018.The primary driver for this change was the current foreign income tax provision, which was $0.2 million in 2019, as compared to $0.9 million in 2018.In 2019, there was a net benefit of $0.3 million from the reserve for uncertain foreign tax positions primarily due to the close of the statute of limitations on several such positions during the year.This compared to 2018, when there was a $0.4 million net expense related to the reserve for uncertain foreign tax positions.The remaining decrease in the current foreign income tax provision was primarily due to reduced profits earned by our wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries as compared to 2018.","## 17 Impairment of Goodwill and Intangibles\n\nBefore recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows:\n\n|          |   31 March 2019 $M |   31 March 2018 $M | |----------|--------------------|--------------------|| Americas |              273.6 |              288.2 | | EMEA     |              413   |              434.2 | | APJ      |

impairment.\n\nWhere the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\nGoodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the cash-generating unit to which it relates is greater than the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use.\n\nFor the year-ended 31 March 2019, the Directors have reviewed the value of goodwill based on internal value in use calculations.The key assumptions for these calculations are discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to billings and direct costs during the period.\n\nThe Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the Directors' most recent financial forecasts for the following five years.The growth rates for the five-year period are based on Directors' expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the cash-generating unit, planned growth in market share, industry forecasts, growth in the market and specific regional considerations and are in line with past experience.Discount rates have been estimated based on rates that reflect current market assessments of the Group's weighted average cost of capital.\n\nThe key assumptions used in the assessments in the year-ended 31 March 2019 are as follows:\n\n|                                                  | Americas   | EMEA   | APJ   |

                | 9.0%       | 9.0%   | 10.0% |\n\nThe key assumptions used in the assessments in the year-ended 31 March 2018 were as follows:\n\n|                                                  | Americas   | EMEA   | APJ   | |--------------------------------------------------|------------|--------|-------| | Long-term regional growth rate beyond five years | 2.5%       | 1.5%   | 2.0%  | | Discount rate                                    | 9.5%       | 9.5%   | 10.5% |\n\nAs at 31 March 2019, there were no indicators of impairment that suggested the carrying amounts of the Group's long-lived assets are not recoverable.In order to assess the sensitivity in the assumptions made, the Directors have flexed the discount rate upward by thirty per cent of the above rates, and noted that this still did not give any indication of impairment."],"1":["## GLOSSARY\n\n## ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES\n\ncontinued\n\nEBITDA: TORM defines EBITDA as earnings before financial income and expenses, depreciation, impairment, amortization and taxes.The computation of EBITDA refers to financial income and expenses which the Company deems to be equivalent to \"interest\" for purposes of presenting EBITDA.Financial expenses consist of interest on borrowings, losses on foreign exchange transactions and bank charges.Financial income consists of interest income and gains on foreign exchange transactions.\n\nEBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by Management and external users of financial statements, such as lenders, to assess TORM's operating performance as well as compliance with the financial covenants and restrictions contained in the Company's financing agreements.TORM believes that EBITDA assists Management and investors by increasing comparability of the Company's performance from period to period.This increased comparability is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects of interest, depreciation, impairment, amortization and taxes.These are items that could be affected by various changing financing methods and capital structure and which may significantly affect profit\/(loss) between periods.Including EBITDA as a measure benefits investors in selecting between investment alternatives.\n\nEBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect profit\/(loss), and these measures may vary among other companies and not be directly comparable.The following table reconciles EBITDA to net profit\/ (loss), the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure, for the periods presented:\n\n| USDm

ended December 31, 2019.This was driven by our $135.6 million purchase of long-term investments, $89.1 million cash paid to acquire intellectual property, $44.3 million in capital expenditures including personnelrelated costs associated with development of internal-use software, and $27.9 million net cash paid for our acquisition of Connect First, Inc.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $213.3 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to our $135.6 million purchase of long-term investments, an increase of $70.6 million in cash paid for the acquisition of intangible assets, and higher capital expenditures during 2019.\n\n## Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities\n\nOur primary financing activities have consisted of raising proceeds through the issuance of stock under our stock plans and issuance of our Notes.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was approximately $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily resulting from $15.2 million in proceeds from the issuance of shares in connection with our stock plans, net of taxes paid.This was partially offset by payments of $5.2 million of contingent consideration associated with acquisitions, and repayment of our financing obligation of $0.9 million.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, decreased by $388.2 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to proceeds from our Notes issued in 2018.\n\n## Backlog\n\nWe have generally signed new customers to contracts that vary in length, from month-to-month to multi-year terms for our subscriptions.The timing of invoicing to our customers is a negotiated term and thus varies among our subscription contracts.Payment terms are generally billed either monthly or on an annual basis.At any point in the contract term, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice, which constitute backlog.Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, we do not recognize them as revenues, unearned revenues or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements.Given the variability in our contract length, we believe that backlog is not a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.\n\n## Deferred Revenue\n\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of invoiced fees for our subscriptions, which we recognize as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy.Customers with annual or multi-year contracts may opt for annual invoicing.For these customers, we generally invoice only one annual subscription period in advance.Therefore, our deferred revenue balance does not capture the full contract value of such multi-year contracts.Accordingly, we believe that deferred revenue is not a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize deferred revenue as a key management metric internally.\n\n## Contractual Obligations\n\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|

provided by operating activities increased $224 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018.The increase was primarily due to more favorable timing of working capital changes including higher advance payments from customers, $59 million received for the Greek arbitration award and lower payments for integration and restructuring costs.These activities were partially offset by higher tax payments, the timing of interest payments and $60 million of proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps in the prior year.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $242 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.The increase was primarily due to lower payments for taxes, integration and restructuring costs and proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps.This was partially offset by $24 million of cash paid related to the 2016 acquisition of Lockheed Martin's Information Systems & Global Solutions business (\"IS&GS Business\").\n\nNet cash provided by investing activities increased $179 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018.The increase was primarily due to $178 million of proceeds received for the dispositions of our commercial cybersecurity and health staff augmentation businesses, $96 million of proceeds received for the sale of real estate properties and $81 million of cash paid in the prior year related to our 2016 acquisition.These activities were partially offset by $94 million of cash paid related to the acquisition of IMX, higher purchases of property, equipment and software and lower proceeds from promissory notes.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $43 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.The increase was primarily due to $81 million of cash paid related to the 2016 acquisition of the IS&GS Business, partially offset by $40 million of proceeds from the settlement of a promissory note.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $2 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018.The increase was primarily due to the timing of debt payments and higher stock repurchases, partially offset by $23 million of cash paid related to a tax indemnification in the prior year and the timing of issuances of stock.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $278 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.The increase was primarily due to $250 million of stock repurchases under the ASR program, $167 million of open market stock repurchases and $23 million of cash paid related to a tax indemnification liability.This was partially offset by $150 million of lower debt payments and $14 million of proceeds received from a real estate financing transaction.\n\n## Off\n\nBalance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe have outstanding
