KPMG's appointment is not legall y req u ired, we are s u bmitting this matter to the shareholders, as in the past, as a matter of good corporate practice.In determining whether to reappoint KPMG as o

res, proposed staffing and the reasonableness of its fees on an absol u te basis and as compared with fees paid b y comparable companies.\n\nIf the shareholders fail to vote on an advisor y basis in favor of the appointment, the A u dit Committee will reconsider whether to retain KPMG, and ma y appoint that firm or another witho u tres u bmitting the matter to the shareholders.Even if the shareholders ratif y the appointment, the A u dit Committee ma y , in its discretion, select a different independent a u ditor at an y time du ring the y ear if it determines that s u ch a change wo u ld be in the Compan y 's best interests.\n\nIn connection with the a u dit of the 2019 financial statements, we entered into an engagement letter with KPMG which sets forth the terms b y which KPMG will provide a u dit services to u s.An y f u t u re disp u tes between KPMG and u s u nder that letter will be s u bject to certain specified alternative disp ute resol u tion proced u res, none of which are intended to restrict the remedies that o u r shareholders might independentl y p u rs u e against KPMG.\n\nThe following table lists the aggregate fees and costs billed to u sb y KPMG and

31, 2019 related to this plan.\n\n## PSU plan\n\nThe Corporation also offers a Performance Share Unit (\"PSU\") Plan for the benefit of its executive officers and designated employees.The objectives of the PSU Plan are to retain executive officers and designated employees, to align their interests with those of the shareholders and to sustain positive corporate performance, as measured by an economic value creation formula, a performance measure used by management.The number of PSUs is based on the dollar value of the award and the average closing stock price of the Corporation for the previous twelve month period ending August 31.The PSUs vest over a three-year less one day period, based on the level of increase in the economic value of the Corporation or the relevant subsidiary for the preceding three-year period ending August 31, meaning that no vesting will occur if there is no increase in the economic value.The participants are entitled to receive dividend equivalents in the form of additional PSUs but only with respect to vested PSUs.PSUs are redeemable in case of death, permanent disability, normal retirement or termination of employment not for cause, in which cases, the holder of PSUs is entitled to payment of the PSUs in proportion to the time of employment from the date of the grant to the date of termination versus the three-year less one day vesting period.\n\nA trust was created for the purpose of purchasing these shares on the stock market in order to protect against stock price fluctuation and the Corporation instructed the trustee to purchase subordinate voting shares of the Corporation on the stock market.These shares are purchased and are held in trust for the participants until they are fully vested.The trust, considered as a special purpose entity, is consolidated in the Corporation's financial statements with the value of the acquired subordinate voting shares held in trust under the PSU Plan presented in reduction of share capital.\n\nUnder the PSU Plan, the following PSUs were granted by the Corporation and are outstanding at August 31:\n\n| Years ended August 31,                     | 2019     | 2018     |

($2,198,000 in 2018) was recorded for the year ended August 31, 2019 related to this plan.\n\n## DSU plan\n\nThe Corporation also offers a Deferred Share Unit (\"DSU\") Plan for members of the Board to assist in the attraction and retention of qualified individuals to serve on the Board of the Corporation.Each existing or new member of the Board may elect to be paid a percentage of the annual retainer in the form of DSUs with the balance, if any, being paid in cash.The number of DSUs that a member is entitled to receive is based on the average closing price of the subordinate shares on the TSX for the twenty consecutive trading days immediately preceding by one day the date of issue.Dividend equivalents are awarded with respect to DSUs in a member's account on the same basis as if the member was a shareholder of record of subordinate shares on the relevant record date, and the dividend equivalents are credited to the individual's account as additional DSUs.DSUs are redeemable and payable in cash or in shares, upon an individual ceasing to be a member of the Board or in the event of the death of the member.\n\nUnder the DSU Plan, the following DSUs were issued by the Corporation and are outstanding at August 31:\n\n| Years ended August 31,             | 2019     | 2018    | |------------------------------------|----------|---------| | Outstanding, beginning of the

31, 2019, is a federal NOL carryforward of $255.4 million.All of the NOL carryforward was incurred subsequent to the enactment of the TCJA and therefore has an indefinite carryforward period.The Company has significant deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to property, plant and equipment, which are expected to reverse and allow for the full utilization of the NOL carryforward.As such, the Company has not recorded a valuation allowance related to the NOL carryforward.Also included in the deferred tax assets are North Carolina Investing in Business Property Credit and North Carolina Jobs Credits totaling $4.9 million, as well as Georgia Job Tax Credits totaling $2.6 million.The North Carolina Investing in Business Property Credit provides a 7% investment tax credit for property located in a North Carolina development area, the North Carolina Creating Jobs Credit provides a tax credit for increased employment in North Carolina, and the Georgia Job Tax Credit provides a tax credit for creation and retention of qualifying jobs in Georgia.It is management's opinion that the majority of the North Carolina and Georgia income tax credits will not be utilized before they expire, and a $5.6 million valuation allowance has been recorded as of October 31, 2019.The North Carolina credits began to expire during fiscal 2018, and the remaining credits expire between fiscal years 2020 and 2023."],"2":["## Tax Carryforwards\n\nThe amount and expiration dates of income tax net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards, which are available to reduce future
