Credit Facility\n\nIn November 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the ''2016 Credit Facility'') with Silicon Valley Bank (''SVB'') as the lender.The 2016 Credit Facility provided a three-year, $25.0 million revolving credit facility, which included a maximum of $25.0 million letter of credit subfacility.Loan advances under the revolving facility were available of up to the full $25.0 million when the balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities minus outstanding revolving loans and letters of credit equaled or exceeded $50.0 million.If our net cash fell below $50.0 million, loan advances were determined based on a borrowing base equal to a specified percentage of the value of our eligible accounts receivable.Loans bore interest, at our option, at (i) the prime rate reported in The Wall Street Journal, minus 0.50% or (ii) a LIBOR rate determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility, plus 2.50%.Over the term of the 2016 Credit Facility, we paid customary closing fees, commitment fees and letter of credit fees for a facility of this size and type.\n\nIn September 2018, we entered into an amendment with SVB to reduce the unused revolving credit facility fee on the 2016 Credit Facility from 0.4% to 0.3%.\n\nOur obligations under the 2016 Credit Facility were secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property.The 2016 Credit Facility required us to maintain compliance with customary affirmative and negative covenants, including compliance with an adjusted quick ratio of not less than 1.50:1.00, as determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility and restricted our ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions on our capital stock.\n\nOn November 1, 2019, the maturity date, we elected to allow the 2016 Credit Facility to expire without renewal.There were no outstanding loans or advances as of the maturity date.We currently have no plans for entering into a new borrowing facility.","| (In millions)                                                | Revised Preliminary  Allocation  As of August 1, 2019   | Measurement  Period  Adjustments   | Revised Preliminary

proprietary technology to deliver the services.Services revenue is also comprised of licensing of our Support.com Cloud applications.Services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by $4.9 million from 2018.The decrease in service revenue was primarily due to the decrease in the billable hours of our major customers.For the year ended December 31, 2019, services revenue generated from our partnerships was $56.6 million compared to $61.0 million for 2018.For the year ended December 31, 2019, direct services revenue was $2.9 million compared to $3.5 million for 2018.As with any market that is undergoing shifts, timing of downward pressures and growth opportunities in our services programs are difficult to predict.We are experiencing downward pressure with some of our services programs as pers onal computer and certain retail markets are subject to internal re-alignment and other sector specific softness.H owever, we still see opportunity in the market for growth with our service partners as a result of the evolving support market trends.","## Results of Operations\n\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of revenue for certain items in our statements

in 2019 was primarily due to lower sales from Display Bridge Solution, eFPGA license and connectivity product, which was partially offset by an increase in AI SaaS revenue.The increase in mature product revenue was due primarily to increased orders from our customers in the defense, aerospace, test and instrumentation sectors.\n\nGross Profit.The table below sets forth the changes in gross

fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018.The increase was primarily due to more favorable timing of working capital changes including higher advance payments from customers, $59 million received for the Greek arbitration award and lower payments for integration and restructuring costs.These activities were partially offset by higher tax payments, the timing of interest payments and $60 million of proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps in the prior year.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $242 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.The increase was primarily due to lower payments for taxes, integration and restructuring costs and proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps.This was partially offset by $24 million of cash paid related to the 2016 acquisition of Lockheed Martin's Information Systems & Global Solutions business (\"IS&GS Business\").\n\nNet cash provided by investing activities increased $179 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018.The increase was primarily due to $178 million of proceeds received for the dispositions of our commercial cybersecurity and health staff augmentation businesses, $96 million of proceeds received for the sale of real estate properties and $81 million of cash paid in the prior year related to our 2016 acquisition.These activities were partially offset by $94 million of cash paid related to the acquisition of IMX, higher purchases of property, equipment and software and lower proceeds from promissory notes.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $43 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.The increase was primarily due to $81 million of cash paid related to the 2016 acquisition of the IS&GS Business, partially offset by $40 million of proceeds from the settlement of a promissory note.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $2 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018.The increase was primarily due to the timing of debt payments and higher stock repurchases, partially offset by $23 million of cash paid related to a tax indemnification in the prior year and the timing of issuances of stock.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $278 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.The increase was primarily due to $250 million of stock repurchases under the ASR program, $167 million of open market stock repurchases and $23 million of cash paid related to a tax indemnification liability.This was partially offset by $150 million of lower debt payments and $14 million of proceeds received from a real estate financing transaction.\n\n## Off\n\nBalance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe have outstanding performance guarantees and cross-indemnity agreements in connection with certain aspects of our business.We also have letters of credit outstanding principally related to performance guarantees on contracts and surety bonds outstanding principally related to performance and subcontractor payment bonds as described in \"Note 26-Commitments\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.These arrangements have not had, and management does not believe it is likely that they will in the future have, a material effect on our liquidity, capital resources, operations or financial condition.","Net cash used in investing activities was $296.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.This was driven by our $135.6 million purchase of long-term investments, $89.1 million cash paid to acquire intellectual property, $44.3 million in capital expenditures including personnelrelated costs associated with development of internal-use software, and $27.9 million net cash paid for our acquisition of Connect First, Inc.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $213.3 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to our $135.6 million purchase of long-term investments, an increase of $70.6 million in cash paid for the acquisition of intangible assets, and higher capital expenditures during 2019.\n\n## Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities\n\nOur primary financing activities have consisted of raising proceeds through the issuance of stock under our stock plans and issuance of our Notes.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was approximately $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily resulting from $15.2 million in proceeds from the issuance of shares in connection with our stock plans, net of taxes paid.This was partially offset by payments of $5.2 million of contingent consideration associated with acquisitions, and repayment of our financing obligation of $0.9 million.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, decreased by $388.2 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to proceeds from our Notes issued in 2018.\n\n## Backlog\n\nWe have generally signed new customers to contracts that vary in length, from month-to-month to multi-year terms for our subscriptions.The timing of invoicing to our customers is a negotiated term and thus varies among our subscription contracts.Payment terms are generally billed either monthly or on an annual basis.At any point in the contract term, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice, which constitute backlog.Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, we do not recognize them as revenues, unearned revenues or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements.Given the variability in our contract length, we believe that backlog is not a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.\n\n## Deferred Revenue\n\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of invoiced fees for our subscriptions, which we recognize as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy.Customers with annual or multi-year contracts may opt for annual invoicing.For these customers, we generally invoice only one annual subscription period in advance.Therefore, our deferred revenue balance does not capture the full contract value of such multi-year contracts.Accordingly, we believe that deferred revenue is not a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize deferred revenue as a key management metric internally.\n\n## Contractual Obligations\n\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                             | Payments due by period   | Payments due by period   | Payments
