for the plans are based upon customary rates and practices for the location of the plans.Factors such as asse t class allocations, long-term rates of return (actual and expected), and results of periodic asset liability modeling studies ar e considered when constructing the long-term rate of return assumption for our defined benefit pension plans.\n\nWeighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the plans at the end of each period were as follows:\n\n|                               | Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   | Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   | Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   | |-------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------| |

appropriate discount rate for the plans, the Company uses country-specific information, adjusted to reflect the duration of the particular plan .The discount rate was based on highly rated long-term bond indexes and yield curves that match the duration of the plan's benefit obligations.\n\n## Defined Contribution Plans\n\nAutodesk also provides defined contribution plans in certain foreign countries where required by statute.Autodesk's funding policy for foreign defined contribution plans is consistent with the local requirements in each country.Autodesk's contributions to these plans were $29.6 million in fiscal 2019, $27.2 million in fiscal 2018, and $26.6 million in fiscal 2017.\n\n## Cash Balance Plans\n\nAutodesk provides a cash balance plan that insures the risks of disability, death, and longevity, in which the vested pension capital is reinvested and provides a 100% capital and interest guarantee.The weighted-average guaranteed interest crediting rate for cash balance plans was 1.0%, 1.0%, and 1.3% for mandatory retirement savings and 0.3%, 0.3%, and 0.8% for supplementary retirement savings for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\n\n## Other Plans\n\nIn addition, Autodesk offers a non-qualified deferred compensation plan to certain key employees whereby they may defer a portion (or all) of their annual compensation until retirement or a different date specified by the employee in accorda nce with terms of the plan.See Note 7, \"Deferred Compensation,\" for further discussion.\n\n## 16.Restructuring and other exit costs, net\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Board of Directors approved a world-wide restructuring plan (\"Fiscal 2018 Plan\") to support the Company's strategic priorities of completing the subscription transition, digitizing the Company, an d re-imagining manufacturing, construction, and production.Through the restructuring, Autodesk seeks to reduce its investments in areas not aligned with its strategic priorities, including in areas related to research and development and go-to-market activities.At the same time, Autodesk plans to further invest in strategic priority areas related to digital infrastructure, c ustomer success, and construction.By re-balancing resources to better align with the Company's strategic priorities, Autodesk is positioning itself to meet its long-term goals.This world-wide restructuring plan included a reduction in force of approximate ly 11% of the Company's workforce, or 1,027 employees, and the consolidation of certain leased facilities.By January 31, 2019, the personnel and facilities related actions included in this restructuring plan were substantially complete.\n\nDuring Fiscal 2019, restructuring charges under the Fiscal 2018 Plan included $39.2 million in employee termination benefits and $3.2 million in lease termination and other exit costs.\n\n<!-\n\nimage -\n\n>\n\nThe following tables set forth the restructuring charges

of 20% compared to fiscal 2018.\n\nGrocery & Snacks net sales for fiscal 2019 were $3.28 billion, a decrease of $7.8 million compared to fiscal 2018.Volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was flat in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior-year period.This result reflected merchandising changes and price elasticity-related declines in certain brands, as well as isolated production challenges, partially offset by the continued benefit from momentum and innovation successes in the snacks businesses.Price\/ mix was flat compared to the prior year as unfavorable mix, coupled with increases in brand building investments with retailers were offset by the impact of higher pricing.The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC, which was completed in October 2017, contributed $41.3 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition.Fiscal 2019 results included $115.9 million of net sales related to our

excluding the impact of acquisitions.The increase in sales volumes was a result of innovation across multiple brands, which was partially offset by the effects of reduced merchandising spend and the impact of a recall during the fourth quarter.Price\/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2018, as continued delivery of top-line accretive innovation in several brands was partially offset by brand building investments with retailers.The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin \u00ae business, which was completed in February 2018, contributed $25.7 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition.\n\nInternational net sales for fiscal 2019 were $793.4 million, a decrease of $50.1 million, or 6%, compared to fiscal

each case compared to fiscal 2018.The volume and price\/ mix increases for fiscal 2019 were driven by growth in the Canadian snacks and frozen businesses.The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $3.7 million to International net sales for fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition.Fiscal 2019 included $4.1 million of net sales related to our Del Monte $^{\u00ae}$ processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada, which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.Fiscal 2018 results included $48.9 million of net sales related to this divested business.In addition, fiscal 2019 and 2018 results included $17.1 million and $24.5 million, respectively, related to our divested Wesson $^{\u00ae}$ oil business.\n\nFoodservice net sales for fiscal 2019 were $934.2 million, a decrease of $120.6 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal 2018.Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 14% decrease in volume, excluding divestitures.The decline in volume reflected the continued execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy and the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.Price\/mix increased 5% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018.The increase in price\/mix for fiscal 2019 reflected favorable product and customer mix, the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing, and the execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy.Fiscal 2019 included $34.2 million of net sales related to our Wesson $^{\u00ae}$ oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.Fiscal 2018 results included $53.4 million of net sales related to this divested business.Net sales declined by approximately 7% in fiscal 2019 due to the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility.\n\nPinnacle Foods net sales for fiscal 2019 (reflecting 213 days of Conagra Brands ownership) were $1.73 billion.Results reflected expected consumption declines as the Company executes its value-over-volume strategy within the Pinnacle portfolio.","## Systems Business\n\nDuring 2019, EDP Renewables, ConnectGen, and Innergex Renewable Energy each accounted for more than 10% of our systems business net sales, and the majority of our systems business net sales were in the United States and Australia.Substantially all of our systems business net sales during 2019 were denominated in U.S. dollars and Australian dollars.We typically recognize revenue for sales of solar power systems using cost based input methods, which result in revenue being recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred compared to the total estimated costs for a given contract.We may also recognize revenue for the sale of a development project, which excludes EPC services, or for the sale of a completed system when we enter into the associated sales contract with the customer.The revenue recognition policies for our systems business are further described in Note 2.\"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2019,

Broadcasting segment strategically acquires assets across the United States, which results in the recording of FCC licenses.Providing the Company acts within the requirements and constraints of the regulatory authorities, the renewal and extension of these licenses is reasonably certain at minimal costs.Accordingly, we have concluded that the acquired FCC licenses are indefinite-lived intangible assets.\n\nIn 2019, FCC licenses increased $15.6 million, $18.2 million of which was through acquisitions, offset by $2.3 million of impairments and $0.3 million loss on the sale of licenses.Our Broadcasting segment recorded the impairment as a result of its decision to forfeit FCC licenses in certain lower-ranked markets, and does not expect any significant changes to future cash flows as a result of these forfeitures.The Company reports intangible impairment charges within the Asset impairment expense line of our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n## Definite Lived Intangible
