- Cost of revenue = Revenue - Gross margin = $110,360 million - $72,007 million = $38,353 million
- Proportion of cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue = (Cost of revenue / Revenue) * 100 = ($38,353 million / $110,360 million) * 100 ≈ 34.75%

For 2019:
- Revenue: $125,843 million

The Company recognized interest and penalties of $2,500 and $2,000 as a component of income tax expense in fiscal year2019 and 2018, respectively.', ""\nThe unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would not impact the Company's effective tax rate as the recognition of these tax benefits would be offset by changes in the Company's valuation allowance. The Company does not believe there will be any material changes in its unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Due to the Company's historical loss position, all tax years from inception through December 31, 2019 remain open due to unutilized net operating losses. The Company files income tax returns in the United States and various states and foreign jurisdictions and is subject to examination by various taxing authorities including major jurisdiction like the United States.
