expense decreased in the year ended December 31, 2018, versus the same period in 2017 primarily due to lower debt balances, a reduction in interest related to interest rate swaps, and a one-time charge related to a liability that was settled in 2017.Interest income increased due to higher interest rates.Other expense in the year ended December 31, 2018, was driven by foreign currency translation losses mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro.Other income in the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven mainly by foreign currency translation gains due to the depreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro.\n\n|                    | Years Ended December 31,   | Years Ended December 31,   |

         | 64.1%                      |\n\nThe effective income tax rate in 2018 was 19.9% compared to 64.1% in the prior year.The tax rate in 2018 was favorably impacted by a discrete one-time rate change benefit related to the Tax Act resulting from the election of tax accounting method changes, partially offset by a one-time withholding tax on repatriation of earnings from one of our foreign subsidiaries that was completed during the year to enable the use of tax credits due to expire in 2018.The tax rate in 2017 was unfavorably impacted by the application of the Tax Act, driven by the remeasurement of the net deferred tax assets from 35% to 21% and the one-time mandatory transition tax on the historical earnings of foreign affiliates, which resulted in a net non-cash charge of $18,001.\n\nNet earnings were $46,532 or $1.39 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to earnings of $14,448 or $0.43 per diluted share in the comparable period of 2017.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $100,241 at December 31, 2019, and $100,933 at December 31, 2018, of which $98,309 and $96,762, respectively, were held outside the United States.The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $692 was primarily driven by cash generated from operating activities of $64,405 and net proceeds from an increase in borrowings of long-term debt of $49,700, which were offset by the payment for the QTI acquisition of $73,906, capital expenditures of $21,733, treasury stock purchases of $11,746, dividends paid of $5,238, and taxes paid on behalf of equity award participants of $2,657.Total debt as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, was $99,700 and $50,000, respectively.Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, defined as long-term debt as a percentage of total debt and shareholders'equity, was 19.7% at December 31, 2019, compared to 11.7% at December 31, 2018.\n\nWorking capital increased by $5,164 from December 31, 2018, to December 31, 2019, driven mainly by the decrease in accrued payroll and benefits due to lower short-term incentive compensation and the decrease in accounts payable, which were partially offset by an increase in operating lease obligations.\n\n## Cash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $64,405 during the year ended December 31, 2019.Components of net cash provided by operating activities included net earnings of $36,146, depreciation and amortization expense of $24,619, stock-based compensation of $5,015, other net non-cash items totaling $5,160, and a net cash outflow from changes in assets and liabilities of $6,535.","## Other income (expense)\n\n|                                         | Year ended March

increased $5.3 million primarily as a result of interest expense of $3.3 million associated with our long-term debt and our financing lease obligation of $2.0 million in connection with the construction of our Lexington, MA - U.S. headquarters.\n\nForeign exchange expense and other, net decreased by $3.1 million primarily as a result of a decrease in foreign exchange expense of $1.9 million, sublease income of $0.9 million and a gain on a previously held asset related to the Solebit acquisition of $0.3 million.\n\n## Provision for income taxes\n\n|                            |

million in the year ended March 31, 2019 compared to the year ended March 31, 2018, which is primarily attributable to the tax benefit provided on the loss of our Israeli entity, and the tax benefit for the release of a portion of pre-existing U.S. and U.K. valuation allowances as a result of the Ataata and Simply Migrate business combinations, partially offset by an increase in income tax provision due to the earnings of our South African entity.\n\n## Comparison of Years Ended March 31, 2018 and 2017\n\n## Revenue\n\n|         | Year ended March 31,   | Year ended March 31,   |

2018 compared to the year ended March 31, 2017.The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to increases in new customers, including approximately 4,000 new customers added since March 31, 2017, a full year of revenue related to new customers added during fiscal 2017 and additional revenue from customers that existed as of March 31, 2017.Revenue for the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the year ended March 31, 2017 was positively impacted by approximately $4.7 million primarily as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the South African rand and to a lesser extent the British pound.\n\n## Cost of revenue\n\n|                 | Year ended March 31,   | Year ended March 31,   | Period-to-period change   | Period-to-period change   |

million in 2019 compared to expense of $1,152 million in 2018.The year-to-year change was primarily driven by:\n\nLower non\n\noperating retirement\n\nrelated costs ($957 million).Refer to \"Retirement\n\nRelated Plans\" for additional information.\n\nHigher gains from divestitures ($833 million) reflected in Other; and\n\nHigher net exchange gains (including derivative instruments) ($272 million).The company's hedging programs help mitigate currency impacts in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nOperating (non-GAAP) other (income) and expense was $1,431 million of income in

only if the related external borrowings are to support the Global Financing external business.Overall interest expense (excluding capitalized interest) in 2019 was $1,952 million, an increase of $473 million year to year, driven by a higher average debt balance and higher interest rates as we issued debt to finance the Red Hat acquisition.\n\nOperating (non-GAAP) interest expense increased $393

$169 million compared to 2018.This was primarily due to increases related to the issuances and conversions of stock-based compensation for Red Hat ($150 million) and issuance of restricted stock units ($27 million).Stock-based compensation cost, and the year-to-year change, was reflected in the following categories:Cost: $100 million, up $18 million; SG&A expense: $453 million, up $91 million; and

2018, primarily driven by a decrease in recognized actuarial losses ($1,123 million), primarily due to the change in the amortization period in the U.S. Qualified Personal Pension Plan and higher expected return on plan assets ($143 million), partially offset by higher interest costs ($203 million).","Other income and expense items are summarized in the following table:\n\nTable of

translation losses mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro.Other income in the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven mainly by foreign

|--------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------||                    | 2018                       | 2017                       | |Effective tax rate | 19.9%                      | 64.1%                      |\n\nThe effective income tax rate in 2018 was 19.9% compared to 64.1% in the prior year.The tax rate in 2018 was favorably impacted by a discrete one-time rate change benefit related to the Tax Act resulting from the election of tax accounting method changes, partially offset by a one-time withholding tax on repatriation of earnings from one of our foreign subsidiaries that was completed during the year to enable the use of tax credits due to expire in 2018.The tax rate in 2017 was unfavorably impacted by the application of the Tax Act, driven by the remeasurement of the net deferred tax assets from 35% to 21% and the one-time mandatory transition tax on the historical earnings of foreign affiliates, which resulted in a net non-cash charge of $18,001.\n\nNet earnings were $46,532 or $1.39 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to earnings of $14,448 or $0.43 per diluted share in the comparable period of 2017.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $100,241 at December 31, 2019, and $100,933 at December 31, 2018, of which $98,309 and $96,762, respectively, were held outside the United States.The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $692 was primarily driven by cash generated from operating activities of $64,405 and net proceeds from an increase in borrowings of long-term debt of $49,700, which were offset by the payment for the QTI acquisition of $73,906, capital expenditures of $21,733, treasury stock purchases of $11,746, dividends paid of $5,238, and taxes paid on behalf of equity award participants of $2,657.Total debt as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, was $99,700 and $50,000, respectively.Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, defined as long-term debt as a percentage of total debt and shareholders'equity, was 19.7% at December 31, 2019, compared to 11.7% at December 31, 2018.\n\nWorking capital increased by $5,164 from December 31, 2018, to December 31, 2019, driven mainly by the decrease in accrued payroll and benefits due to lower short-term incentive compensation and the decrease in accounts payable, which were partially offset by an increase in operating lease obligations.\n\n## Cash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $64,405 during the year ended December 31, 2019.Components of net cash provided by operating activities included net earnings of $36,146, depreciation and amortization expense of $24,619, stock-based compensation of $5,015, other net non-cash items totaling $5,160, and a net cash outflow from changes in assets and liabilities of $6,535."],"2":["<!-\n\nimage -\n\n>\n\nWe measure and report our annual scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions.As part of our commitment to reduce our Greenhouse Gas ('GHG') emissions, we moved to a certified green tariff renewable electricity supply contract for our UK operations from the beginning of the financial year.\n\nThe GHG emissions summary below shows our gross emissions including location-based scope 2 emissions, as well as our net emissions accounting for the market-based scope 2 reporting for our certified green electricity tariff.\n\nThe reduction in emissions is driven by continued progress in energy efficiency, a reduction in emissions associated with refrigerants as we continue to move away from fluorinated gas refrigerants, and the general reduction in UK grid carbon factor as more renewables make up a greater proportion of the fuel mix.\n\nOver the last six years, we have made good progress in our water consumption per tonne of product, reducing it by 15% over the period.There was also a significant improvement in FY19, and one of the contributing factors to the improvement was the closure of the Evercreech desserts facility which had a higher water intensity than most sites within the business.\n\n## Water consumption per tonne of product - UK

distribution for decades, but now our approach to their use is changing.We work with our customers to look for the best packaging solutions for all our products, that take into account the environmental impact, while keeping our food fresher for longer.We are committed to working with our customers to reducing our use of single-use plastics and partnering with suppliers to find effective alternatives.\n\nWe support the UK Plastics Pact and are committed to meeting its 2025 targets.We will monitor and reduce the amount of plastics used to transport and consume our products, and we aim to develop a circular system whereby plastic is used less and kept out of the environment.Throughout FY19, we have engaged with all key customers and have plans to remove remaining 'hard to recycle' packaging as soon as possible.\n\nIn FY19, we saved 18.7 tonnes of plastic by replacing the black plastic trays in a ready meal range with foil.Activities targeting relatively small pieces of plastic such as 'windows' on quiche boxes have also led to significant reductions in plastic use.\n\nWe have recycled 758 tonnes of plastic from our manufacturing and distribution activities in FY19 and have identified opportunities for further improvements in the future.","## 2.Use of resources\n\n## 2.1 Office Buildings\n\n| Indicators                                                     | For
