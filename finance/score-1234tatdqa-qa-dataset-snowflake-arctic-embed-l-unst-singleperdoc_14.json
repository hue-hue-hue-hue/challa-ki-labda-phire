discount rate was determined by comparison against the FTSE pension liability index for AA rated corporate instruments.The Company monitors other indices to assure that the pension obligations are fairly reported on a consistent basis.The international discount rates were determined by comparison against country specific AA corporate indices, adjusted for duration of the obligation.\n\nThe periodic benefit cost and the actuarial present value of projected benefit obligations are based on actuarial assumptions that are reviewed on an annual basis.The Company revises these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of longterm trends, as well as market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits.","## Benefit Obligations\n\nThe act u arial ass u

liability is primarily attributable to the Company's decision to take bonus depreciation on qualifying assets placed in service during fiscal 2019.\n\nIncluded in the deferred tax assets at October 31, 2019, is a federal NOL carryforward of $255.4 million.All of the NOL carryforward was incurred subsequent to the enactment of the TCJA and therefore has an indefinite carryforward period.The Company has significant deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to property, plant and equipment, which are expected to reverse and allow for the full utilization of the NOL carryforward.As such, the Company has not recorded a valuation allowance related to the NOL carryforward.Also included in the deferred tax assets are North Carolina Investing in Business Property Credit and North Carolina Jobs Credits totaling $4.9 million, as well as Georgia Job Tax Credits totaling $2.6 million.The North Carolina Investing in Business Property Credit provides a 7% investment tax credit for property located in a North Carolina development area, the North Carolina Creating Jobs Credit provides a tax credit for increased employment in North Carolina, and the Georgia Job Tax Credit provides a tax credit for creation and retention of qualifying jobs in Georgia.It is management's opinion that the majority of the North Carolina and Georgia income tax credits will not be utilized before they expire, and a $5.6 million valuation allowance has been recorded as of October 31, 2019.The North Carolina credits began to expire during fiscal 2018, and the remaining credits expire between fiscal years 2020 and 2023.","The components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in thousands):\n\n|                                                 | Year Ended December 31,

sales allowances, deferred rent, and other miscellaneous accruals.As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $117.5 million and $109.6 million, respectively.The Company also had deferred tax liabilities of $12.3 million and $16.1 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income, if any, the amount and timing of which is uncertain.Based on the available objective evidence, and historical operating performance, management believes that it is more likely than not that all U.S. and certain foreign deferred tax assets are not realizable.Accordingly, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset with a valuation allowance.The net valuation allowance increased by approximately $11.9 million and $10.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $285.9 million which will begin to expire in the year 2020.The Company had state net and foreign operating loss carryforwards of approximately $268.1 million and $24.8 million, respectively.As of December 31, 2019, the Company has research credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $16.0 million which will begin to expire in the year 2032.The Company also had state net research credit carryforwards for income tax purposes of approximately $18.3 million which can be carried forward indefinitely.The Company also had MAT credit carry forwards for Indian income tax purposes of approximately $0.7 million which will begin to expire in the year 2030.\n\nA reconciliation of the gross unrecognized tax benefit is as follows (in

benefits, if recognized, would not impact the Company's effective tax rate as the recognition of these tax benefits would be offset by changes in the Company's valuation allowance.The Company does not believe there will be any material changes in its unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.Due to the Company's historical loss position, all tax years from inception through December 31, 2019 remain open due to unutilized net operating losses.\n\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States and various states and foreign jurisdictions and is subject to examination by various taxing authorities including major jurisdiction like the United States.As such, all its net operating loss and research credit carryforwards that may be used in future years are subject to adjustment, if and when utilized.\n\nUtilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state

for office facilities.These leases have terms which typically range from 1 year to 5 years , and often include options to renew.These renewal terms can extend the lease term up to 6 years, and are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option.Effective January 1, 2019, these operating leases are included as right-ofuse assets in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, as a result of the adoption of the new leasing standard as discussed under Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, and represent the Company's right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.The present value of the Company's obligation to make lease payments are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nBased on the present value of the lease payments for the remaining lease term of the Company's existing leases, the Company recognized 1) right-of-use assets of $8.5 million, adjusted for deferred rent and lease incentives as of the adoption date, and 2) lease liabilities for operating leases of $11.5 million on January 1, 2019.Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities commencing after January 1, 2019 are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term."]},"response":{"0":"The Group adopted the revised
