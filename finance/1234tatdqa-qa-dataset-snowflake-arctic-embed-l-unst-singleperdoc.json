uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities.Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, consisting of net loss of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $26.2 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million.Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $16.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $10.0 million.The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an outflow from the changes in accrued liabilities and other of $5.9 million and inventory of $5.6 million, partially offset by an inflow from changes in deferred revenue of $3.2 million.\n\nThe unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and other was driven by an increase in lease liabilities associated with the lease of the San Jose corporate office.The unfavorable change in inventory was due to build up of inventory and timing of shipments, partially offset by increased reserves.The favorable change in deferred revenues was primarily driven by increased bookings.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million, consisting of net loss of $27.6 million which includes payments for our internal investigation costs of $8.6 million, non-cash charges of $25.0 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million.Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.9 million.The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $3.1 million, offset primarily by an outflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $6.1 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and inventory of $1.5 million.\n\nThe favorable change in deferred revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the sale of subscription and support.The favorable change in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, increased value added tax accrual due to timing of payments, and an increase in legal fees accrual.The unfavorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections.The unfavorable change in prepaid and other assets was mainly driven by the increase in deferred sales commissions due to higher deferred revenue and higher average commission rate.The unfavorable change in inventory was due to the timing of shipments.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $14.3 million, consisting of a net loss of $10.8 million, a cash decrease resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million and non-cash charges of $26.4 million.Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $17.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance of $1.1 million.The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $12.4 million and deferred revenue of $3.0 million, and an outflow from the change in accrued liabilities of $8.9 million, inventory of $4.7 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of

       |\n\n## Cash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nOur cash provided by operating activities is driven primarily by sales of our products and management of working capital investments.Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities.Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, consisting of net loss of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $26.2 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million.Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $16.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $10.0 million.The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an outflow from the changes in accrued liabilities and other of $5.9 million and inventory of $5.6 million, partially offset by an inflow from changes in deferred revenue of $3.2 million.\n\nThe unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and other was driven by an increase in lease liabilities associated with the lease of the San Jose corporate office.The unfavorable change in inventory was due to build up of inventory and timing of shipments, partially offset by increased reserves.The favorable change in deferred revenues was primarily driven by increased bookings.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million, consisting of net loss of $27.6 million which includes payments for our internal investigation costs of $8.6 million, non-cash charges of $25.0 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million.Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.9 million.The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $3.1 million, offset primarily by an outflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $6.1 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and inventory of $1.5 million.\n\nThe favorable change in deferred revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the sale of subscription and support.The favorable change in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, increased value added tax accrual due to timing of payments, and an increase in legal fees accrual.The unfavorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections.The unfavorable change in prepaid and other assets was mainly driven by the increase in deferred sales commissions due to higher deferred revenue and higher average commission rate.The unfavorable change in inventory was due to the timing of shipments.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $14.3 million, consisting of a net loss of $10.8 million, a cash decrease resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million and non-cash charges of $26.4 million.Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $17.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance of $1.1 million.The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $12.4 million and deferred revenue of $3.0 million, and an outflow from the change in accrued liabilities of $8.9 million, inventory of $4.7 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and accounts payable of $0.9 million.",

Credit Facility\n\nIn November 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the ''2016 Credit Facility'') with Silicon Valley Bank (''SVB'') as the lender.The 2016 Credit Facility provided a three-year, $25.0 million revolving credit facility, which included a maximum of $25.0 million letter of credit subfacility.Loan advances under the revolving facility were available of up to the full $25.0 million when the balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities minus outstanding revolving loans and letters of credit equaled or exceeded $50.0 million.If our net cash fell below $50.0 million, loan advances were determined based on a borrowing base equal to a specified percentage of the value of our eligible accounts receivable.Loans bore interest, at our option, at (i) the prime rate reported in The Wall Street Journal, minus 0.50% or (ii) a LIBOR rate determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility, plus 2.50%.Over the term of the 2016 Credit Facility, we paid customary closing fees, commitment fees and letter of credit fees for a facility of this size and type.\n\nIn September 2018, we entered into an amendment with SVB to reduce the unused revolving credit facility fee on the 2016 Credit Facility from 0.4% to 0.3%.\n\nOur obligations under the 2016 Credit Facility were secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property.The 2016 Credit Facility required us to maintain compliance with customary affirmative and negative covenants, including compliance with an adjusted quick ratio of not less than 1.50:1.00, as determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility and restricted our ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions on our capital stock.\n\nOn November 1, 2019, the maturity date, we elected to allow the 2016 Credit Facility to expire without renewal.There were no outstanding loans or advances as of the maturity date.We currently have no plans for entering into a new borrowing facility.",

            "Net cash used in investing activities was $296.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.This was driven by our $135.6 million purchase of long-term investments, $89.1 million cash paid to acquire intellectual property, $44.3 million in capital expenditures including personnelrelated costs associated with development of internal-use software, and $27.9 million net cash paid for our acquisition of Connect First, Inc.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $213.3 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to our $135.6 million purchase of long-term investments, an increase of $70.6 million in cash paid for the acquisition of intangible assets, and higher capital expenditures during 2019.\n\n## Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities\n\nOur primary financing activities have consisted of raising proceeds through the issuance of stock under our stock plans and issuance of our Notes.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was approximately $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily resulting from $15.2 million in proceeds from the issuance of shares in connection with our stock plans, net of taxes paid.This was partially offset by payments of $5.2 million of contingent consideration associated with acquisitions, and repayment of our financing obligation of $0.9 million.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, decreased by $388.2 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to proceeds from our Notes issued in 2018.\n\n## Backlog\n\nWe have generally signed new customers to contracts that vary in length, from month-to-month to multi-year terms for our subscriptions.The timing of invoicing to our customers is a negotiated term and thus varies among our subscription contracts.Payment terms are generally billed either monthly or on an annual basis.At any point in the contract term, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice, which constitute backlog.Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, we do not recognize them as revenues, unearned revenues or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements.Given the variability in our contract length, we believe that backlog is not a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.\n\n## Deferred Revenue\n\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of invoiced fees for our subscriptions, which we recognize as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy.Customers with annual or multi-year contracts may opt for annual invoicing.For these customers, we generally invoice only one annual subscription period in advance.Therefore, our deferred revenue balance does not capture the full contract value of such multi-year contracts.Accordingly, we believe that deferred revenue is not a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize deferred revenue as a key management metric internally.\n\n## Contractual Obligations\n\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                             | Payments due by period   | Payments due by period   | Payments due by period   | Payments due by period   | Payments due by period   | |-----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------| |                             | Up to  1 year            | 1 to 3 years             | 3 to 5 years             | More than  5 years       | Total                    | | Operating lease obligations | 16,164                   | 19,812                   | 6,551                    | 5,883                    | 48,410                   | |Financing obligations       | 2,956                    | 5,912                    | -

March 2021.For previous awards, the Group's performance had been measured by reference to the cumulative profit measure (Underlying operating profit for 2015 and 2016 awards, and Operating profit for 2017 awards) and total shareholder return relative to the FTSE 250 share index.\n\n120 |"

            "## Net Cash Used In Investing Activities\n\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $250.0 million, from $693.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 to $443.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.The decrease is attributable to a decrease of $203.7 million in net cash used in payments for the construction costs of newbuildings and other fixed assets, a net increase of $45.5 million in cash from short-term investments in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period of 2018 and an increase of $0.8 million in cash from interest income.\n\n## Net Cash Provided By Financing Activities\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased by $318.0 million, from $368.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 to $50.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.The decrease is mainly attributable to an increase of $316.0 million in bank loan repayments, a decrease of $208.4 million in proceeds from the GasLog Partners' issuance of preference units, a decrease of $60.4 million in proceeds from the GasLog Partners' common unit offerings, an increase of $46.7 million in payments for NOK bond repurchase at a premium, an increase of $26.6 million in cash used for purchases of treasury shares or common units of GasLog Partners, an increase of $18.5 million in payments of loan issuance costs, an increase of $15.4 million in dividend payments on common and preference shares, an increase of $3.7 million in payments for cross currency swaps' termination, an increase of $2.6 million in payments for lease liabilities, an increase of $0.8 million in payments for equity-related costs and a decrease of $0.5 million in proceeds from stock option exercise, partially offset by an increase of $381.6 million in proceeds from borrowings.\n\n## Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018\n\nThe following table summarizes our net cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years indicated:\n\n|                                                  | Year ended December 31,   | Year ended December 31,   | Year ended December 31,   | |--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------| |                                                  | 2017                      | 2018                      | Change                    | |Amounts in thousands of U.S. dollars             |                           |                           |                           | |Net cash provided by operating activities ......| $223,630                  | $ 283,710                 | $ 60,080                  | |Net cash used in investing activities ..........| (74,599)                  | (692,999)                 | (618,400)                 | |Net cash provided by financing activities ......| 7,265                     | 368,120                   | 360,855                   |\n\n## Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $60.1 million, from $223.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $283.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.The increase was attributable to an increase in total revenues (revenues and net pool allocation) of $103.7 million, partially offset by a decrease of $23.5 million caused by movements in working capital accounts, an increase of $15.3 million in cash paid for interest including the interest paid for finance leases and a net decrease of $4.8 million from the remaining movements.\n\n## Net Cash Used In Investing Activities\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $618.4 million, from $74.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $693.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.The increase is mainly attributable to an increase of $591.5 million in payments for the construction costs of newbuildings and other fixed assets and a net decrease in cash from short-term investments of $43.0 million in 2018 compared to 2017.The above movements were partially offset by $14.0 million in payments made for the investment in Gastrade made in 2017 and an increase of $2.1 million in cash from interest income.",
            "Net cash used in investing activities was $296.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.This was driven by our $135.6 million purchase of long-term investments, $89.1 million cash paid to acquire intellectual property, $44.3 million in capital expenditures including personnelrelated costs associated with development of internal-use software, and $27.9 million net cash paid for our acquisition of Connect First, Inc.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $213.3 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to our $135.6 million purchase of long-term investments, an increase of $70.6 million in cash paid for the acquisition of intangible assets, and higher capital expenditures during 2019.\n\n## Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities\n\nOur primary financing activities have consisted of raising proceeds through the issuance of stock under our stock plans and issuance of our Notes.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was approximately $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily resulting from $15.2 million in proceeds from the issuance of shares in connection with our stock plans, net of taxes paid.This was partially offset by payments of $5.2 million of contingent consideration associated with acquisitions, and repayment of our financing obligation of $0.9 million.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, decreased by $388.2 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to proceeds from our Notes issued in 2018.\n\n## Backlog\n\nWe have generally signed new customers to contracts that vary in length, from month-to-month to multi-year terms for our subscriptions.The timing of invoicing to our customers is a negotiated term and thus varies among our subscription contracts.Payment terms are generally billed either monthly or on an annual basis.At any point in the contract term, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice, which constitute backlog.Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, we do not recognize them as revenues, unearned revenues or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements.Given the variability in our contract length, we believe that backlog is not a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.\n\n## Deferred Revenue\n\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of invoiced fees for our subscriptions, which we recognize as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy.Customers with annual or multi-year contracts may opt for annual invoicing.For these customers, we generally invoice only one annual subscription period in advance.Therefore, our deferred revenue balance does not capture the full contract value of such multi-year contracts.Accordingly, we believe that deferred revenue is not a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize deferred revenue as a key management metric internally.\n\n## Contractual Obligations\n\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                             | Payments due by period   | Payments due by period   | Payments due by period   | Payments due by period   | Payments due by period   | |-----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------| |                             | Up to  1 year            | 1 to 3 years             | 3 to 5 years             | More than  5 years       | Total                    | | Operating lease obligations | 16,164                   | 19,812                   | 6,551                    | 5,883                    | 48,410                   | |Financing obligations       | 2,956                    | 5,912                    | -

and\n\nHigher net exchange gains (including derivative instruments) ($272 million).The company's hedging programs help mitigate currency impacts in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nOperating (non-GAAP) other (income) and expense was $1,431 million of income in 2019 and increased $1,010 million compared to the prior-year period.The year-to-year change was primarily driven by the same factors excluding lower non-operating retirement-related costs.\n\n## Interest Expense\n\n($ in millions)\n\n|For the year ended December 31:                      | 2019   | 2018   | Yr.-to-Yr.Percent  Change   | |------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-------------------------------| | Interest expense                                     | $1,344 | $723   | 85.9%                         | | Non-operating adjustment Acquisition-related charges | (228)  | -      | NM                            | | Operating (non-GAAP)  interest expense               | $1,116 | $723   | 54.4%                         |\n\nNM\n\nNot meaningful\n\nInterest expense increased $621 million compared to 2018.Interest expense is presented in cost of financing in the Consolidated Income Statement only if the related external borrowings are to support the Global Financing external business.Overall interest expense (excluding capitalized interest) in 2019 was $1,952 million, an increase of $473 million year to year, driven by a higher average debt balance and higher interest rates as we issued debt to finance the Red Hat acquisition.\n\nOperating (non-GAAP) interest expense increased $393 million compared to the prior-year period.It excludes the Red Hat pre-closing debt financing costs.\n\n## Stock\n\nBased Compensation\n\nPre-tax stock-based compensation cost of $679 million increased $169 million compared to 2018.This was primarily due to increases related to the issuances and conversions of stock-based compensation for Red Hat ($150 million) and issuance of restricted stock units ($27 million).Stock-based compensation cost, and the year-to-year change, was reflected in the following categories:Cost: $100 million, up $18 million; SG&A expense: $453 million, up $91 million; and RD&E expense: $126 million, up $60 million.\n\n## Retirement\n\nRelated Plans\n\nThe following table provides the total pre-tax cost for all retirement-related plans.Total operating costs/(income) are included in the Consolidated Income Statement within the caption (e.g., Cost, SG&A, RD&E) relating to the job function of the plan participants.\n\n($ in millions)\n\n| For the year ended December 31:                | 2019    | 2018    | Yr.-to-Yr.\n\nPercent  Change   | |------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|-------------------------------| | Retirement-related  plans-cost                 |         |         |                               | | Service cost                                   | $ 385   | $ 431   | (10.7)%                       | | Multi-employer plans                           | 32      | 38      | (16.9)                        | | Cost of defined  contribution plans            | 1,040   | 1,024   | 1.5                           | | Total operating costs/ (income)                | $ 1,457 | $ 1,494 | (2.5)%                        | | Interest cost                                  | $ 2,929 | $ 2,726 | 7.4%                          | | Expected return on plan assets                 | (4,192) | (4,049)| 3.5                           | | Recognized actuarial  losses                   | 1,819   | 2,941   | (38.2)                        | | Amortization of prior  service costs/(credits)| (9)     | (73)    | (87.6)                        | | Curtailments/settlements                       | 41      | 11      | 262.2                         | | Other costs                                    | 28      | 16      | 76.2                          | | Total non-operating costs/(income)             | $ 615   | $ 1,572 | (60.9)%                       | | Total retirement-related plans-cost            | $ 2,072 | $ 3,066 | (32.4)%                       |\n\nTotal pre-tax retirement-related plan cost decreased by $994 million compared to 2018, primarily driven by a decrease in recognized actuarial losses ($1,123 million), primarily due to the change in the amortization period in the U.S. Qualified Personal Pension Plan and higher expected return on plan assets ($143 million), partially offset by higher interest costs ($203 million).",

            "## 17 Impairment of Goodwill and Intangibles\n\nBefore recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows:\n\n|          |   31 March 2019 $M |   31 March 2018 $M | |----------|--------------------|--------------------|| Americas |              273.6 |              288.2 | | EMEA     |              413   |              434.2 | | APJ      |               98.7 |              103.6 | |          |              785.3 |              826   |\n\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets is tested annually, or more frequently where there is indication of impairment.\n\nWhere the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\nGoodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the cash-generating unit to which it relates is greater than the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use.\n\nFor the year-ended 31 March 2019, the Directors have reviewed the value of goodwill based on internal value in use calculations.The key assumptions for these calculations are discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to billings and direct costs during the period.\n\nThe Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the Directors' most recent financial forecasts for the following five years.The growth rates for the five-year period are based on Directors' expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the cash-generating unit, planned growth in market share, industry forecasts, growth in the market and specific regional considerations and are in line with past experience.Discount rates have been estimated based on rates that reflect current market assessments of the Group's weighted average cost of capital.\n\nThe key assumptions used in the assessments in the year-ended 31 March 2019 are as follows:\n\n|                                                  | Americas   | EMEA   | APJ   | |--------------------------------------------------|------------|--------|-------| | Long-term regional growth rate beyond five years | 2.5%       | 1.5%   | 2.0%  | | Discount rate                                    | 9.0%       | 9.0%   | 10.0% |\n\nThe key assumptions used in the assessments in the year-ended 31 March 2018 were as follows:\n\n|                                                  | Americas   | EMEA   | APJ   | |--------------------------------------------------|------------|--------|-------| | Long-term regional growth rate beyond five years | 2.5%       | 1.5%   | 2.0%  | | Discount rate                                    | 9.5%       | 9.5%   | 10.5% |\n\nAs at 31 March 2019, there were no indicators of impairment that suggested the carrying amounts of the Group's long-lived assets are not recoverable.In order to assess the sensitivity in the assumptions made, the Directors have flexed the discount rate upward by thirty per cent of the above rates, and noted that this still did not give any indication of impairment."

            "## GLOSSARY\n\n## ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES\n\ncontinued\n\nEBITDA: TORM defines EBITDA as earnings before financial income and expenses, depreciation, impairment, amortization and taxes.The computation of EBITDA refers to financial income and expenses which the Company deems to be equivalent to \"interest\" for purposes of presenting EBITDA.Financial expenses consist of interest on borrowings, losses on foreign exchange transactions and bank charges.Financial income consists of interest income and gains on foreign exchange transactions.\n\nEBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by Management and external users of financial statements, such as lenders, to assess TORM's operating performance as well as compliance with the financial covenants and restrictions contained in the Company's financing agreements.TORM believes that EBITDA assists Management and investors by increasing comparability of the Company's performance from period to period.This increased comparability is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects of interest, depreciation, impairment, amortization and taxes.These are items that could be affected by various changing financing methods and capital structure and which may significantly affect profit/(loss) between periods.Including EBITDA as a measure benefits investors in selecting between investment alternatives.\n\nEBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect profit/(loss), and these measures may vary among other companies and not be directly comparable.The following table reconciles EBITDA to net profit/ (loss), the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure, for the periods presented:\n\n| USDm                                            | 2019   | 2018   | 2017   | |-------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------| | Reconciliation to net profit/(loss)             |        |        |        | | Net profit/(loss) for the year                  | 166.0  | -34.8  | 2.4    | | Tax                                             | 0.8    | 1.6    | 0.8    | |Financial expenses                              | 41.9   | 39.3   | 40.6   | | Financial income                                | -2.8   | -3.3   | -4.3   | |Depreciation                                    | 110.1  | 114.5  | 114.5  | | Impairment (reversal)/losses on tangible assets | -114.0| 3.2    | 3.6    | | EBITDA                                          | 202.0  | 120.5  | 157.6  |\n\nLoan-to-value (LTV): TORM defines Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio as Vessel values divided by net borrowings on the vessels.\n\nLTV describes the net debt ratio on the vessel, and is used by TORM to describe the financial situation, the liquidity risk as well as to express the future possibilities to raise new capital by new loan facilities.\n\n| USDm                                                                              | 2019    | 2018    | 2017    | |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------| | Vessel values including newbuildings (broker values)                              | 1,801.5 | 1,675.1 | 1,661.1 | | Total (value)                                                                     | 1,801.5 | 1,675.1 | 1,661.1 | | Borrowings                                                                        | 863.4   | 754.7   | 753.9   | | - Hereof debt regarding Land and buildings & Other plant  and operating equipment | -8.7    | -       | -       | | Committed CAPEX on newbuildings                                                   | 51.2    | 258.0   | 306.9   | | Loans receivables                                                                 | -4.6    | -       | -       | | Cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash                              | -72.5   | -127.4  | -134.2  | | Total (loan)                                                                      | 828.8   | 885.3   | 926.6   | | Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio                                                         | 46.0%   | 52.9%   | 55.8%   |",

            "Net cash used in investing activities was $296.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.This was driven by our $135.6 million purchase of long-term investments, $89.1 million cash paid to acquire intellectual property, $44.3 million in capital expenditures including personnelrelated costs associated with development of internal-use software, and $27.9 million net cash paid for our acquisition of Connect First, Inc.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $213.3 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to our $135.6 million purchase of long-term investments, an increase of $70.6 million in cash paid for the acquisition of intangible assets, and higher capital expenditures during 2019.\n\n## Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities\n\nOur primary financing activities have consisted of raising proceeds through the issuance of stock under our stock plans and issuance of our Notes.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was approximately $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily resulting from $15.2 million in proceeds from the issuance of shares in connection with our stock plans, net of taxes paid.This was partially offset by payments of $5.2 million of contingent consideration associated with acquisitions, and repayment of our financing obligation of $0.9 million.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, decreased by $388.2 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to proceeds from our Notes issued in 2018.\n\n## Backlog\n\nWe have generally signed new customers to contracts that vary in length, from month-to-month to multi-year terms for our subscriptions.The timing of invoicing to our customers is a negotiated term and thus varies among our subscription contracts.Payment terms are generally billed either monthly or on an annual basis.At any point in the contract term, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice, which constitute backlog.Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, we do not recognize them as revenues, unearned revenues or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements.Given the variability in our contract length, we believe that backlog is not a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.\n\n## Deferred Revenue\n\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of invoiced fees for our subscriptions, which we recognize as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy.Customers with annual or multi-year contracts may opt for annual invoicing.For these customers, we generally invoice only one annual subscription period in advance.Therefore, our deferred revenue balance does not capture the full contract value of such multi-year contracts.Accordingly, we believe that deferred revenue is not a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize deferred revenue as a key management metric internally.\n\n## Contractual Obligations\n\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                             | Payments due by period   | Payments due by period   | Payments due by period   | Payments due by period   | Payments due by period   | |-----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------| |                             | Up to  1 year            | 1 to 3 years             | 3 to 5 years             | More than  5 years       | Total                    | | Operating lease obligations | 16,164                   | 19,812                   | 6,551                    | 5,883                    | 48,410                   | |Financing obligations       | 2,956                    | 5,912                    | -

            "At the end of each reporting period, the Company evaluates all available information at that time to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of these credits will be utilized.As of October 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, the Company determined that a total of $1.8 million, $0.7 million, and $0.6 million, respectively, would be recovered.Accordingly, those amounts were released from the valuation allowance and benefited deferred tax expense in the respective periods.\n\nThe differences between the consolidated effective income tax rate and the federal statutory rate effective during the applicable year presented are as follows:\n\n|                                        | Years Ended October 31,   | Years Ended October 31,   | Years Ended October 31,   | |----------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------| |                                        | 2019                      | 2018                      | 2017                      | |                                        | (In thousands)            | (In thousands)            | (In thousands)            | | Income taxes at statutory rate         | $ 13,408                  | $ 7,132                   | $ 148,585                 | | Discrete benefit resulting from TCJA   | -                         | (37,505)                  | -                         | | State income taxes                     | 1,189                     | 1,014                     | 9,038                     | | State income tax credits               | (2,139)                   | (804)                     | (606)                     |\n\n| Expiration of state income tax credits | 4,121                     | 4,117                     | 642                       | | Federal income tax credits             | (474)                     | (460)                     | (390)                     | | Federal manufacturers deduction        | -                         | -                         | (11,527)                  | | Excess tax benefits                    | (1,388)                   | (1,638)                   | (3,345)                   | | Nondeductible expenses                 | 1,786                     | 1,890                     | 3,506                     | | Change in valuation allowance          | (5,380)                   | (5,297)                   | (1,106)                   | | Other                                  | (570)                     | 677                       | (12)                      | | Income tax expense (benefit)           | $ 10,553                  | $ (30,874)                | $ 144,785                 |\n\n## 8.Earnings Per Share\n\nCertain share-based payment awards entitling holders to receive non-forfeitable dividends before vesting are considered participating securities and thus included in the calculation of basic earnings per share, to the extent they are dilutive.These awards are included in the calculation of basic earnings per share under the two-class method.The two-class method allocates earnings for the period between common shareholders and other security holders.The participating awards receiving dividends are allocated the same amount of income as if they were outstanding shares.\n\nThe following table presents earnings per share (in thousands).\n\n|                                                                          | For the years ended   |For the years ended   |For the years ended   | |--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------| |                                                                          | October 31, 2019      | October 31, 2018      | October 31, 2017      | |Net income                                                               | $ 53,294              | $ 61,431              | $ 279,745             | |Distributed and undistributed (earnings) to unvested restricted          | (778)                 | (878)                 | (4,285)               | | kDistributed and undistributed earnings to common shareholders -  Basic | 52,516                | 60,553                | 275,460               | |Weighted average shares outstanding - Basic                              | 21,829                | 22,429                | 22,393                | |Weighted average shares outstanding - Diluted                            | 21,829                | 22,429                | 22,393                | | Earnings per common share - Basic                                        | $ 2.41                | $ 2.70                | $ 12.30               | | Earnings per common share - Diluted                                      | $ 2.41                | $ 2.70                | $ 12.30               |"

            "## Systems Business\n\nDuring 2019, EDP Renewables, ConnectGen, and Innergex Renewable Energy each accounted for more than 10% of our systems business net sales, and the majority of our systems business net sales were in the United States and Australia.Substantially all of our systems business net sales during 2019 were denominated in U.S. dollars and Australian dollars.We typically recognize revenue for sales of solar power systems using cost based input methods, which result in revenue being recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred compared to the total estimated costs for a given contract.We may also recognize revenue for the sale of a development project, which excludes EPC services, or for the sale of a completed system when we enter into the associated sales contract with the customer.The revenue recognition policies for our systems business are further described in Note 2.\"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\"

selling price per watt.Net sales from our systems segment decreased by $139.0 million in 2019 primarily as a result of the sale of the Mashiko and certain India projects in 2018 and the completion of substantially all construction activities at the California Flats, Willow Springs, and various other projects in Florida in late 2018 and early 2019, partially offset by the sale of the Sun Streams, Sunshine Valley, and Beryl projects and ongoing construction activities at the Phoebe and GA Solar 4 projects in 2019.\n\n## Cost of sales\n\n## Modules Business\n\nOur modules business cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components for manufacturing solar modules, such as glass, transparent conductive coatings, CdTe and other thin film semiconductors, laminate materials, connector assemblies, edge seal materials, and frames.In addition, our cost of sales includes direct labor for the manufacturing of solar modules and manufacturing overhead, such as engineering, equipment maintenance, quality and production control, and information technology.Our cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment, facility-related expenses, environmental health and safety costs, and costs associated with shipping, warranties, and solar module collection and recycling (excluding accretion).\n\n## Systems Business\n\nFor our systems business, project-related costs include development costs (legal, consulting, transmission upgrade, interconnection, permitting, and other similar costs), EPC costs (consisting primarily of solar

high profitability have often reflected increased consumer demand relative to supply while the periods of significant loss have often reflected excess supply for the then prevailing consumer demand.Historically, demand for shell eggs increases in line with overall population growth.As reflected above, our operating results fluctuate with changes in the spot egg market quote and feed costs.The net average shell egg selling price is the blended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs, including non-graded shell egg sales, breaking stock and undergrades.In fiscal 2017, our net average selling price and dozens sold decreased over the previous fiscal year primarily due to the oversupply of eggs resulting from the repopulation of the national flock of laying hens to levels exceeding the flock size prior to the avian influenza outbreak in 2015, along with a reduced demand for egg products.In fiscal 2018, strong demand resulted in an increase in our average selling price and dozens sold, and feed costs decreased over prior years.Fiscal 2019 saw an increasing U.S. flock size result in oversupply of eggs, particularly in the last half of the fiscal year.This resulted in decreased gross profit and net income for fiscal 2019.\n\n## Fiscal Year Ended June 1, 2019Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 2, 2018\n\n## NET SALES\n\nNet sales for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019 were $1,361.2 million, a decrease of $141.7 million, or 9.4%, from net sales of $1,502.9 million for fiscal 2018.The decrease was primarily due to lower selling prices for non-specialty eggs in fiscal 2019 due to the oversupply of eggs, particularly in the last half of the fiscal year, contrasted with fiscal 2018 in which we experienced strong demand resulting in higher prices for non-specialty eggs.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, shell egg sales made up approximately 97% of our net sales.Total dozens sold in fiscal 2019 were 1,038.9 million, an increase of 1.2 million dozen, or 0.1%, compared to 1,037.7 million sold in fiscal 2018 resulting in an increase in net sales of $1.7 million for fiscal 2019 compared with the prior year.\n\nNet average selling price of shell eggs decreased from $1.397 per dozen for fiscal 2018 to $1.265 per dozen for fiscal 2019, a decrease of $0.132 per dozen, or 9.4%, primarily reflecting an abundance of eggs in the market.The decrease in sales price in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2018 resulted in a corresponding decrease in net sales of approximately $137.1 million.Our operating results are significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices, which are outside of our control.Small changes in production or demand levels can have a large effect on shell egg prices.\n\nEgg products accounted for approximately 3% of our net sales.These revenues were $41.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019 compared with $43.5 million for the fiscal 2018.\n\nThe table below represents an analysis of our non-specialty and specialty, as well as co-pack specialty, shell egg sales.Following the table is a discussion of the information presented in the table.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                                      | Fiscal Years

            "## Note F1, cont'd.\n\n## Impairment of trade receivables and contract assets\n\nTrade receivables and contract assets are assessed for impairment under a unified model.The Company has determined that credit risk largely depends on both the risk in the country where the customer resides (e.g. ability to make cross border payments) as well as the payment pattern of the customer.Therefore, expected credit losses (ECLs) are calculated using a provision matrix that specifies a fixed rate depending both on the number of days past due and the country risk rating.The country risk ratings depends on the ratings used by all Export Credit Agencies within the OECD.The rates defined in the provision matrix are based on historical loss patterns for that grouping of customers.These rates are adjusted for current conditions as well as management expectations for changes to political risks and payment patterns in the future.The provision rates are higher on high risk countries compared to low risk countries and also higher on amounts that remain unpaid for longer periods of time.There were no significant changes to the model during the year.\n\nTrade receivables and contract assets together amounted to SEK 55,240 (64,350) million as of December 31, 2019.Provisions for expected credit losses on trade receivables and contract assets amounted to SEK 2,983 (4,123) million as of December 31, 2019.The allowance decreased in 2019 due to improvement in cash collection resulting in significant reduction of total past due invoices.The Company's write-offs have historically been low.During the year SEK 382 (890) million were written off due to the Company having no reasonable expectation of collection.Of these write-offs, SEK 0 (61) million are still subject to enforcement.\n\n## Movements in allowances for impairment of trade receivables and contract assets\n\n|                                        | 2019   | 2018   |

relates to contract assets.\n\nThe distribution of trade receivables and contract assets closely follows the distribution of the Company's sales, see note B1, \"Segment information.\"The ten largest customers represented 49% (53%) of the total trade receivables and contract assets in 2019.\n\n| Aging analysis of gross values by risk category at December 31, 2019   | Aging analysis of gross values

procedure for the Board of Directors and according to the established credit approval process.\n\nPrior to the approval of new facilities reported as customer finance, an internal credit risk assessment is conducted in order to assess the credit rating of each transaction for political and commercial risk.The credit risk analysis is made by using an assessment tool, where the political risk rating is identical to the rating used by all Export Credit Agencies within the OECD.The commercial risk is assessed by analyzing a large number of parameters, which may affect the level of the future commercial credit risk exposure.The output from the assessment tool for the credit rating also includes an internal pricing of the risk.This is expressed as a risk margin per annum over funding cost.The reference pricing for political and commercial risk, on which the tool is based, is reviewed using information from Export Credit Agencies and prevailing pricing in the bank loan and bond markets for structured financed deals.The objective is that the internally set risk margin shall reflect the assessed risk and that the pricing is as close as possible to the current market pricing.A reassessment of the credit rating for each customer finance facility is made on a regular basis.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, the total amount payable to the Company under customer finance credits was SEK 5,924 (4,247) million.The carrying value of these assets was SEK 3,756 (2,883) million as of December 31, 2019, which represents the maximum exposure to credit risk on these assets.Customer finance is arranged for infrastructure projects in different geographic markets.As of December 31, 2019, there were a total of 80 (94) customer finance arrangements originated by or guaranteed by the Company.The five largest facilities represented 69% (62%) of the customer finance exposure in 2019.As of December 31, 2019, Middle East and Africa made up 49% (57%) of the oustanding exposure while South East Asia, Oceania and India made up 29% (15%).As of December 31, 2019, the Company also had unutilized customer finance commitments of SEK 25,854 (30,270) million.\n\nSecurity arrangements for customer finance facilities may include pledges of equipment, pledges of certain assets belonging to the borrower and pledges of shares in the operating company.If available, third-party risk coverage is, as a rule, arranged.\"Third-party risk coverage\" means that a financial payment guarantee covering the credit risk has been issued by a bank, an export credit agency or an insurance company.All such institutions have been rated at least investment grade.A credit risk transfer under a sub-participation arrangement with a bank can also be arranged.In this case the entire credit risk and the funding is taken care of by the bank for the part that they cover.\n\nInformation about financial guarantees related to customer finance is included in note D2, \"Contingent liabilities.\"\n\nThe table below summarizes the Company's outstanding customer finance as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\n## Outstanding customer finance credit risk exposure 1)\n\n|

coverage | 3,485  | 2,615  |\n\n1)This table has been adjusted to show the maximum exposure to credit risk.\n\n## Fair value assessment of customer finance credits\n\nCustomer finance risk exposures are held at fair value and are classified as Level 3 on the fair value hierarchy.The Credit Asset Management Team within Ericsson Credit AB, reporting to Head of Group Treasury and Customer Finance, has established a process with respect to measurement of fair values.The quarterly credit review uses an internal model to determine a commercial rating for each credit and for calculation of the fair value.The model is based on external credit rating, political/country rating and bank pricing.Regular monitoring of customer behavior is also a part of the internal assessment.Revaluation of customer finance amounted to a net negative impact in the income statement of SEK 804 (1,073) million in 2019, of which SEK 804 (1,073) million is related to credits held as of December 31, 2019.This effect is presented within selling and administrative expenses and was mainly related to India and the Middle East, especially Iran and Iraq.\n\n## Customer finance fair value reconciliation\n\n|

to the increase in 5G buildout this year, demand for customer financing solutions has increased.Most of such financing has been successfully transferred to banks, hence the balance of customer finance receivables remains low.",

            "return appropriate for each category of assets weighted for the distribution within the diversified investment fund.The assumptions used for the plans are based upon customary rates and practices for the location of the plans.Factors such as asse t class allocations, long-term rates of return (actual and expected), and results of periodic asset liability modeling studies ar e considered when constructing the long-term rate of return assumption for our defined benefit pension plans.\n\nWeighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the plans at the end of each period were as follows:\n\n|                               | Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   | Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   | Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   |

plans, the Company uses country-specific information, adjusted to reflect the duration of the particular plan .The discount rate was based on highly rated long-term bond indexes and yield curves that match the duration of the plan's benefit obligations.\n\n## Defined Contribution Plans\n\nAutodesk also provides defined contribution plans in certain foreign countries where required by statute.Autodesk's funding policy for foreign defined contribution plans is consistent with the local requirements in each country.Autodesk's contributions to these plans were $29.6 million in fiscal 2019, $27.2 million in fiscal 2018, and $26.6 million in fiscal 2017.\n\n## Cash Balance Plans\n\nAutodesk provides a cash balance plan that insures the risks of disability, death, and longevity, in which the vested pension capital is reinvested and provides a 100% capital and interest guarantee.The weighted-average guaranteed interest crediting rate for cash balance plans was 1.0%, 1.0%, and 1.3% for mandatory retirement savings and 0.3%, 0.3%, and 0.8% for supplementary retirement savings for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\n\n## Other Plans\n\nIn addition, Autodesk offers a non-qualified deferred compensation plan to certain key employees whereby they may defer a portion (or all) of their annual compensation until retirement or a different date specified by the employee in accorda nce with terms of the plan.See Note 7, \"Deferred Compensation,\" for further discussion.\n\n## 16.Restructuring and other exit costs, net\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Board of Directors approved a world-wide restructuring plan (\"Fiscal 2018 Plan\") to support the Company's strategic priorities of completing the subscription transition, digitizing the Company, an d re-imagining manufacturing, construction, and production.Through the restructuring, Autodesk seeks to reduce its investments in areas not aligned with its strategic priorities, including in areas related to research and development and go-to-market activities.At the same time, Autodesk plans to further invest in strategic priority areas related to digital infrastructure, c ustomer success, and construction.By re-balancing resources to better align with the Company's strategic priorities, Autodesk is positioning itself to meet its long-term goals.This world-wide restructuring plan included a reduction in force of approximate ly 11% of the Company's workforce, or 1,027 employees, and the consolidation of certain leased facilities.By January 31, 2019, the personnel and facilities related actions included in this restructuring plan were substantially complete.\n\nDuring Fiscal 2019, restructuring charges under the Fiscal 2018 Plan included $39.2 million in employee termination benefits and $3.2 million in lease termination and other exit costs.\n\n<!-\n\nimage -\n\n>\n\nThe following tables set forth the restructuring charges and other facility exit costs, net during the fiscal

            "## Systems Business\n\nDuring 2019, EDP Renewables, ConnectGen, and Innergex Renewable Energy each accounted for more than 10% of our systems business net sales, and the majority of our systems business net sales were in the United States and Australia.Substantially all of our systems business net sales during 2019 were denominated in U.S. dollars and Australian dollars.We typically recognize revenue for sales of solar power systems using cost based input methods, which result in revenue being recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred compared to the total estimated costs for a given contract.We may also recognize revenue for the sale of a development project, which excludes EPC services, or for the sale of a completed system when we enter into the associated sales contract with the customer.The revenue recognition policies for our systems business are further described in Note 2.\"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017:\n\n|

selling price per watt.Net sales from our systems segment decreased by $139.0 million in 2019 primarily as a result of the sale of the Mashiko and certain India projects in 2018 and the completion of substantially all construction activities at the California Flats, Willow Springs, and various other projects in Florida in late 2018 and early 2019, partially offset by the sale of the Sun Streams, Sunshine Valley, and Beryl projects and ongoing construction activities at the Phoebe and GA Solar 4 projects in 2019.\n\n## Cost of sales\n\n## Modules Business\n\nOur modules business cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components for manufacturing solar modules, such as glass, transparent conductive coatings, CdTe and other thin film semiconductors, laminate materials, connector assemblies, edge seal materials, and frames.In addition, our cost of sales includes direct labor for the manufacturing of solar modules and manufacturing overhead, such as engineering, equipment maintenance, quality and production control, and information technology.Our cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment, facility-related expenses, environmental health and safety costs, and costs associated with shipping, warranties, and solar module collection and recycling (excluding accretion).\n\n## Systems Business\n\nFor our systems business, project-related costs include development costs (legal, consulting, transmission upgrade, interconnection, permitting, and other similar costs), EPC costs (consisting primarily of solar modules, inverters, electrical and mounting hardware, project management and engineering, and construction labor), and site specific costs.\n\nThe following table shows cost of sales by reportable

uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities.Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, consisting of net loss of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $26.2 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million.Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $16.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $10.0 million.The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an outflow from the changes in accrued liabilities and other of $5.9 million and inventory of $5.6 million, partially offset by an inflow from changes in deferred revenue of $3.2 million.\n\nThe unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and other was driven by an increase in lease liabilities associated with the lease of the San Jose corporate office.The unfavorable change in inventory was due to build up of inventory and timing of shipments, partially offset by increased reserves.The favorable change in deferred revenues was primarily driven by increased bookings.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million, consisting of net loss of $27.6 million which includes payments for our internal investigation costs of $8.6 million, non-cash charges of $25.0 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million.Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.9 million.The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $3.1 million, offset primarily by an outflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $6.1 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and inventory of $1.5 million.\n\nThe favorable change in deferred revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the sale of subscription and support.The favorable change in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, increased value added tax accrual due to timing of payments, and an increase in legal fees accrual.The unfavorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections.The unfavorable change in prepaid and other assets was mainly driven by the increase in deferred sales commissions due to higher deferred revenue and higher average commission rate.The unfavorable change in inventory was due to the timing of shipments.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $14.3 million, consisting of a net loss of $10.8 million, a cash decrease resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million and non-cash charges of $26.4 million.Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $17.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance of $1.1 million.The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $12.4 million and deferred revenue of $3.0 million, and an outflow from the change in accrued liabilities of $8.9 million, inventory of $4.7 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of

            "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n## 24.Post employment benefits\n\nThe Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans for our employees.The Group's largest defined benefit scheme is in the UK.For further details see \"Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\" in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nFor defined benefit retirement plans, the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the plan liabilities is recognised as an asset or liability on the statement of financial position.Scheme liabilities are assessed using the projected unit funding method and applying the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting period date.Assets are valued at market value.\n\nActuarial gains and losses are taken to the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.For this purpose, actuarial gains and losses comprise both the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising from differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred.The return on plan assets, in excess of interest income, and costs incurred for the management of plan assets are also taken to other comprehensive income.\n\nOther movements in the net surplus or deficit are recognised in the income statement, including the current service cost, any past service cost and the effect of any settlements.The interest cost less the expected interest income on assets is also charged to the income statement.The amount charged to the income statement in respect of these plans is included within operating costs or in the Group's share of the results of equity accounted operations, as appropriate.\n\nThe Group's contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the income statement as they fall due.\n\n## Background\n\nAt 31 March 2019 the Group operated a number of pension plans for the benefit of its employees throughout the world, with varying rights and obligations depending on the conditions and practices in the countries concerned.The Group's pension plans are provided through both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements.Defined benefit schemes provide benefits based on the employees' length of pensionable service and their final pensionable salary or other criteria.Defined contribution schemes offer employees individual funds that are converted into benefits at the time of retirement.\n\nThe Group operates defined benefit schemes in Germany, Ghana, India, Ireland, Italy, the UK, the United States and the Group operates defined benefit indemnity plans in Greece and Turkey.Defined contribution pension schemes are currently provided in Egypt, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Portugal, South Africa, Spain and the UK.\n\n## Income statement expense\n\n|                                                    |   2019  €m |   2018  €m |   2017  €m |

benefit schemes                            |         57 |         44 |         20 | | Total amount charged to income statement (note 23) |        223 |        222 |        212 |\n\n## Defined benefit schemes\n\nThe Group's retirement policy is to provide competitive pension provision, in each operating country, in line with the market median for that location.The Group's preferred retirement provision is focused on Defined Contribution ('DC') arrangements and/or State provision for future service.\n\nThe Group's main defined benefit funding liability is the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme ('Vodafone UK plan').Since June 2014 the plan has consisted of two segregated sections: the Vodafone Section and the Cable & Wireless Section ('CWW Section').Both sections are closed to new entrants and to future accrual.The Group also operates smaller funded and unfunded plans in the UK, funded and unfunded plans in Germany and funded plans in Ireland.Defined benefit pension provision exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as longer than expected longevity of participants, lower than expected return on investments and higher than expected inflation, which may increase the liabilities or reduce the value of assets of the schemes.\n\nThe main defined benefit schemes are administered by trustee boards which are legally separate from the Group and consist of representatives who are employees, former employees or are independent from the Company.The boards of the pension schemes are required by legislation to act in the best interest of the participants, set the investment strategy and contribution rates and are subject to statutory funding objectives.\n\nThe Vodafone UK plan is registered as an occupational pension plan with HM Revenue and Customs ('HMRC') and is subject to UK legislation and operates within the framework outlined by the Pensions Regulator.UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently and that valuations are undertaken at least every three years.Separate valuations are required for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section.\n\nThe trustees obtain regular actuarial valuations to check whether the statutory funding objective is met and whether a recovery plan is required to restore funding to the level of the agreed technical provisions.On 19 October 2017, the 31 March 2016 triennial actuarial valuation for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section of the Vodafone UK plan, which is used to judge the funding the Group needs to put into the scheme, was concluded."

            "## 3.Revenue\n\n## (a) Disaggregation of Revenue\n\nWe disaggregate our revenue into groups of similar products and services that depict the nature, amount, and timing of revenue and cash flows for our various offerings.The sales cycle, contractual obligations, customer requirements, and go-to-market strategies differ for each of our product categories, resulting in different economic risk profiles for each category.\n\nThe following table presents this disaggregation of revenue (in millions):\n\n| Years Ended                                                                                                                      | July 27, 2019   | July 28, 2018   | July 29, 2017   | |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------| | Revenue:                                                                                                                         |                 |                 |                 | |Infrastructure Platforms . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .| $ 30,191        | $ 28,322        | $ 27,817        | | Applications . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .| 5,803           | 5,036           | 4,568           | | Security . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .| 2,730           | 2,352           | 2,152           | | Other Products . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .| 281             | 999             | 1,168           | | Total Product . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .| 39,005          | 36,709          | 35,705          | | Services . . . . . . . ..\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .| 12,899          | 12,621          | 12,300          | | Total  (1) .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .| $ 51,904        | $ 49,330        | $ 48,005        |\n\nAmounts may not sum due to rounding.\n\nInfrastructure Platforms consist of our core networking technologies of switching, routing, wireless, and data center products that are designed to work together to deliver networking capabilities and transport and/or store data.These technologies consist of both hardware and software offerings, including software licenses and software-as-a-service (SaaS), that help our customers build networks, automate, orchestrate, integrate, and digitize data.We are shifting and expanding more of our business to software and subscriptions across our core networking portfolio.Our hardware and perpetual software in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control.Term software licenses are multiple performance obligations where the term license is recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.\n\nApplications consists of offerings that utilize the core networking and data center platforms to provide their functions.The products consist primarily of software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS, as well as hardware.Our perpetual software and hardware in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control.Term software licenses are multiple performance obligations where the term license is recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.\n\nSecurity primarily includes our network security, cloud and email security, identity and access management, advanced threat protection, and unified threat management products.These products consist of both hardware and software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS. Updates and upgrades for the term software licenses are critical for our software to perform its intended commercial purpose because of the continuous need for our software to secure our customers' network environments against frequent threats.Therefore, security software licenses are generally represented by a single distinct performance obligation with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.Our hardware and perpetual software in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control.SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.\n\nOther Products primarily include our Service Provider Video Software Solutions and cloud and system management products.On October 28, 2018, we completed the sale of the SPVSS.These products include both hardware and software licenses.Our offerings in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control.\n\nIn addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service and support options for our customers, including technical support services and advanced services.Technical support services represent the majority of these offerings which are distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.Advanced services are distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time with revenue recognized as services are delivered.\n\nThe sales arrangements as discussed above are typically made pursuant to customer purchase orders based on master purchase or partner agreements.Cash is received based on our standard payment terms which is typically 30 days.We provide financing arrangements to customers for all of our hardware, software and service offerings.Refer to Note 8 for additional information.For these arrangements, cash is typically received over time.\n\n## (b) Contract Balances\n\nAccounts receivable, net was $5.5 billion as of July 27, 2019 compared to $5.6 billion as of July 28, 2018.\n\nContract assets consist of unbilled receivables and are recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of scheduled billings to our customers.These amounts are primarily related to software and service arrangements where transfer of control has occurred but we have not yet invoiced.As of July 27, 2019 and July 29, 2018, our contract assets for these unbilled receivables were $860 million and $122 million, respectively, and were included in other current assets and other assets.\n\nContract liabilities consist of deferred revenue.Deferred revenue was $18.5 billion as of July 27, 2019 compared to $19.7 billion as of July 28, 2018.In connection with the adoption of ASC 606, we recorded an adjustment to retained earnings to reduce deferred revenue by $2.8 billion.We recognized approximately $9.6 billion of revenue during fiscal 2019 that was included in the deferred revenue balance at July 29, 2018.\n\n## (c) Remaining Performance Obligations\n\nRemaining Performance Obligations (RPO) are comprised of deferred revenue plus unbilled contract revenue.As of July 27, 2019, the aggregate amount of RPO was $25.3 billion, comprised of $18.5 billion of deferred revenue and $6.8 billion of unbilled contract revenue.We expect approximately 56% of this amount to be recognized as revenue over the next year.Unbilled contract revenue represents non-cancelable contracts for which we have not invoiced, have an obligation to perform, and revenue has not yet been recognized in the financial statements.\n\n## (d) Capitalized Contract Acquisition Costs\n\nIn connection with the adoption of ASC 606, we began to capitalize direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire contracts, primarily sales commissions, for which the associated revenue is expected to be recognized in future periods.We incur these costs in connection with both initial contracts and renewals.These costs are initially deferred and typically amortized over the term of the customer contract which corresponds to the period of benefit.Deferred sales commissions were $750 million as of July 27, 2019, and was included in other current assets and other assets.The amortization expense associated with these costs was $471 million for fiscal 2019 and was included in sales and marketing expenses.\n\n## 4.Acquisitions and Divestitures\n\n## (a) Acquisition Summary\n\nWe completed five acquisitions during fiscal 2019.A summary of the allocation of the total purchase consideration is presented as follows (in millions):\n\n| Fiscal 2019

|\n\nOn September 28, 2018, we completed our acquisition of privately held Duo Security, Inc. (\"Duo\"), a leading provider of unified access security and multi-factor authentication delivered through the cloud.Revenue from the Duo acquisition has been included in our Security product category.\n\nOn February 6, 2019, we completed our acquisition of Luxtera, Inc. (\"Luxtera\"), a privately held semiconductor company.Revenue from the Luxtera acquisition has been included in our Infrastructure Platforms product category.\n\nThe total purchase consideration related to our acquisitions completed during fiscal 2019 consisted of cash consideration and vested share-based awards assumed.The total cash and cash equivalents acquired from these acquisitions was approximately $100 million."

            "## 17 Impairment of Goodwill and Intangibles\n\nBefore recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows:\n\n|          |   31 March 2019 $M |   31 March 2018 $M | |----------|--------------------|--------------------|| Americas |              273.6 |              288.2 | | EMEA     |              413   |              434.2 | | APJ      |               98.7 |              103.6 | |          |              785.3 |              826   |\n\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets is tested annually, or more frequently where there is indication of impairment.\n\nWhere the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\nGoodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the cash-generating unit to which it relates is greater than the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use.\n\nFor the year-ended 31 March 2019, the Directors have reviewed the value of goodwill based on internal value in use calculations.The key assumptions for these calculations are discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to billings and direct costs during the period.\n\nThe Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the Directors' most recent financial forecasts for the following five years.The growth rates for the five-year period are based on Directors' expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the cash-generating unit, planned growth in market share, industry forecasts, growth in the market and specific regional considerations and are in line with past experience.Discount rates have been estimated based on rates that reflect current market assessments of the Group's weighted average cost of capital.\n\nThe key assumptions used in the assessments in the year-ended 31 March 2019 are as follows:\n\n|                                                  | Americas   | EMEA   | APJ   | |--------------------------------------------------|------------|--------|-------| | Long-term regional growth rate beyond five years | 2.5%       | 1.5%   | 2.0%  | | Discount rate                                    | 9.0%       | 9.0%   | 10.0% |\n\nThe key assumptions used in the assessments in the year-ended 31 March 2018 were as follows:\n\n|                                                  | Americas   | EMEA   | APJ   | |--------------------------------------------------|------------|--------|-------| | Long-term regional growth rate beyond five years | 2.5%       | 1.5%   | 2.0%  | | Discount rate                                    | 9.5%       | 9.5%   | 10.5% |\n\nAs at 31 March 2019, there were no indicators of impairment that suggested the carrying amounts of the Group's long-lived assets are not recoverable.In order to assess the sensitivity in the assumptions made, the Directors have flexed the discount rate upward by thirty per cent of the above rates, and noted that this still did not give any indication of impairment.",

|\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n## Impairment of Long\n\nLived Assets\n\nAt least annually or more frequently as circumstances dictate, Autodesk reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever impairment indicators exist.Autodesk continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate the carrying amounts of its long-lived assets may not be recoverable.When such events or changes in circumstances occur, Autodesk assesses recoverability of these assets.Recoverability is measured by comparison of the carrying amounts of the assets to the future undiscounted cash flow the assets are expected to generate.If the long-lived assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value.Autodesk did not recognize any material impairments of long-lived assets during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\n\nIn addition to the recoverability assessments, Autodesk routinely reviews the remaining estimated useful lives of its longlived assets.Any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made, as well as in subsequent quarters.\n\n## Deferred Tax Assets\n\nDeferred tax assets arise primarily from tax credits, net operating losses, and timing differences for reserves, accrued liabilities, stock options, deferred revenue, purchased technologies, and capitalized intangibles, partially offset by U.S. def erred tax liabilities on acquired intangibles, and valuation allowances against U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets.Autodesk performed a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets and believes it will generate sufficien t future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize the net deferred tax assets.They are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse.Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce gross deferred tax assets to the amount that is \"more likely than not\" to b e realized.\n\n## Stock\n\nbased Compensation Expense\n\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation

payment awards using a Black-Scholes Merton (\"BSM\") option pricing model or the quoted stock price on the date of grant, unless the awards are subject to market conditions, in whi ch case Autodesk uses a binomial-lattice model (e.g., Monte Carlo simulation model).The Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables to estimate the probability that market conditions will be achieved.Autodesk uses the following assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock-based awards:\n\n|                                    | Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2019   | Fiscal Year Ended

for stock-based awards based on the average of the following two measures: (1) a measure of historical volatility in the trading market for the Company's common stock, and (2) the implied volatility of traded forward call options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock.The expected volatility for performance stock units subject to market conditions includes the expected volatility of Autodesk's peer companies within the S&P Computer Software Select Index or S&P North American Technology Software Index with a market capitalization over $2.00 billion, depending on the award type.\n\nAutodesk estimates the expected life of stock-based awards using both exercise behavior and post-vesting termination behavior as well as consideration of outstanding options.The range of expected lives of ESPP awards are based upon the four, six-month exercise periods within a 24-month offering period.\n\nAutodesk did not pay cash dividends in fiscal 2019, 2018, or 2017 and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.Consequently, an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the BSM option pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation model.\n\nThe risk-free interest rate used in the BSM option pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation model for stock-based awards is the historical yield on U.S. Treasury securities with equivalent remaining lives.\n\nAutodesk recognizes expense only for the stock-based awards that ultimately vest.Autodesk accounts for forfeitures of stock-based awards as those forfeitures occur.\n\n## Advertising Expenses\n\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred.Total advertising expenses incurred were $37.5 million in fiscal 2019, $31.1 million in fiscal 2018, and $33.6 million in fiscal 2017.\n\n## Net Loss Per Share\n\nBasic net loss per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period, excluding stock options and restricted stock.Diluted net loss per share is computed based upon the weighted average shares of common shares outstanding for the period and potentially dilutive common shares, including the effect of stock options and restricted stock units under the treasury stock method.\n\n## Defined Benefit Pension Plans\n\nThe funded status of Autodesk's defined benefit pension plans is recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation for the fiscal years presented.The projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement based on employee services already rendered and estimated future compensation levels.The fair value of

|\n\nThe $29.3 million increase in our cost of license and subscription revenue was primarily attributable to increases of $14.9 million in personnel expenses, $8.6 million in cloud infrastructure costs incurred in order to support the growth of our subscription offerings, $3.3 million in royalties, $1.8 million in professional services, and $0.9 million related to the amortization of internal-use software development and acquired intangible assets.Cloud infrastructure costs include $9.5 million of hosting related costs that were recorded in cost of services revenue in fiscal year 2018.The treatment of these hosting related costs is consistent with the treatment of the related revenue in each fiscal year.\n\nWe anticipate higher cost of license and subscription revenue as we continue to invest in our cloud operations to increase operational efficiency and scale while growing our customer base.\n\nCost of maintenance revenue increased by $1.7 million primarily due to the increase in personnel required to support our term and perpetual license customers.\n\nOur cost of services revenue would have increased if cloud infrastructure costs totaling $9.5 million were not reclassified to cost of license and subscription revenue, consistent with the treatment of the related revenue.Excluding the impact of this reclassification, third-party consultants billable to customers primarily for InsuranceNow implementation engagements increased by $3.2 million and personnel expenses related to new and existing employees increased by $2.8 million.\n\nWe had 781 professional service employees and 198 technical support and licensing operations employees at July 31, 2019 compared to 838 professional services employees and 121 technical support and licensing operations employees at July 31, 2018.",

            "Under the ISU Plan, the following ISUs were granted by the Corporation and are outstanding at August 31:\n\n| Years ended August 31,             | 2019     | 2018     |

$2,046,000 ($2,461,000 in 2018) was recorded for the year ended August 31, 2019 related to this plan.\n\n## PSU plan\n\nThe Corporation also offers a Performance Share Unit (\"PSU\") Plan for the benefit of its executive officers and designated employees.The objectives of the PSU Plan are to retain executive officers and designated employees, to align their interests with those of the shareholders and to sustain positive corporate performance, as measured by an economic value creation formula, a performance measure used by management.The number of PSUs is based on the dollar value of the award and the average closing stock price of the Corporation for the previous twelve month period ending August 31.The PSUs vest over a three-year less one day period, based on the level of increase in the economic value of the Corporation or the relevant subsidiary for the preceding three-year period ending August 31, meaning that no vesting will occur if there is no increase in the economic value.The participants are entitled to receive dividend equivalents in the form of additional PSUs but only with respect to vested PSUs.PSUs are redeemable in case of death, permanent disability, normal retirement or termination of employment not for cause, in which cases, the holder of PSUs is entitled to payment of the PSUs in proportion to the time of employment from the date of the grant to the date of termination versus the three-year less one day vesting period.\n\nA trust was created for the purpose of purchasing these shares on the stock market in order to protect against stock price fluctuation and the Corporation instructed the trustee to purchase subordinate voting shares of the Corporation on the stock market.These shares are purchased and are held in trust for the participants until they are fully vested.The trust, considered as a special purpose entity, is consolidated in the Corporation's financial statements with the value of the acquired subordinate voting shares held in trust under the PSU Plan presented in reduction of share capital.\n\nUnder the PSU Plan, the following PSUs were granted by the Corporation and are outstanding at August 31:\n\n| Years ended August 31,                     | 2019     | 2018     | |--------------------------------------------|----------|----------|| Outstanding, beginning of the year         | 133,181  | 115,207

Deferred Share Unit (\"DSU\") Plan for members of the Board to assist in the attraction and retention of qualified individuals to serve on the Board of the Corporation.Each existing or new member of the Board may elect to be paid a percentage of the annual retainer in the form of DSUs with the balance, if any, being paid in cash.The number of DSUs that a member is entitled to receive is based on the average closing price of the subordinate shares on the TSX for the twenty consecutive trading days immediately preceding by one day the date of issue.Dividend equivalents are awarded with respect to DSUs in a member's account on the same basis as if the member was a shareholder of record of subordinate shares on the relevant record date, and the dividend equivalents are credited to the individual's account as additional DSUs.DSUs are redeemable and payable in cash or in shares, upon an individual ceasing to be a member of the Board or in the event of the death of the member.\n\nUnder the DSU Plan, the following DSUs were issued by the Corporation and are outstanding at August 31:\n\n| Years ended August 31,             | 2019     | 2018    |

uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities.Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, consisting of net loss of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $26.2 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million.Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $16.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $10.0 million.The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an outflow from the changes in accrued liabilities and other of $5.9 million and inventory of $5.6 million, partially offset by an inflow from changes in deferred revenue of $3.2 million.\n\nThe unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and other was driven by an increase in lease liabilities associated with the lease of the San Jose corporate office.The unfavorable change in inventory was due to build up of inventory and timing of shipments, partially offset by increased reserves.The favorable change in deferred revenues was primarily driven by increased bookings.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million, consisting of net loss of $27.6 million which includes payments for our internal investigation costs of $8.6 million, non-cash charges of $25.0 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million.Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.9 million.The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $3.1 million, offset primarily by an outflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $6.1 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and inventory of $1.5 million.\n\nThe favorable change in deferred revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the sale of subscription and support.The favorable change in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, increased value added tax accrual due to timing of payments, and an increase in legal fees accrual.The unfavorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections.The unfavorable change in prepaid and other assets was mainly driven by the increase in deferred sales commissions due to higher deferred revenue and higher average commission rate.The unfavorable change in inventory was due to the timing of shipments.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $14.3 million, consisting of a net loss of $10.8 million, a cash decrease resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million and non-cash charges of $26.4 million.Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $17.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance of $1.1 million.The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $12.4 million and deferred revenue of $3.0 million, and an outflow from the change in accrued liabilities of $8.9 million, inventory of $4.7 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of

            "Free Cash Flow ( non-U .S .GAAP measure ).We also present Free Cash Flow, which is a non-U.S. GAAP measure, defined as (i) net cash from operating activities plus (ii) net cash used in investing activities, excluding payment for purchases (and proceeds from the sale) of marketable securities, and net cash variation for joint ventures deconsolidation, which are considered as temporary financial investments.The result of this definition is ultimately net cash from operating activities plus payment for purchase and proceeds from sale of tangible, intangible and financial assets, proceeds received in the sale of businesses and cash paid for business acquisitions.We believe Free Cash Flow, a non-U.S. GAAP measure, provides useful information for investors and management because it measures our capacity to generate cash from our operating and investing activities to sustain our operations.Free Cash Flow is not a U.S. GAAP measure and does not represent total cash flow since it does not include the cash flows generated by or used in financing activities.Free Cash Flow reconciles with the total cash flow and the net cash increase (decrease) by including the payment for purchases (and proceeds from the sale) of marketable securities and net cash variation from joint ventures deconsolidation, the net cash from (used in) financing activities and the effect of changes in exchange rates.\n\nIn addition, our definition of Free Cash Flow may differ from definitions used by other companies.Free Cash Flow is determined from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as follows:\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                                                                                                                                   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------| |                                                                                                                                   | 2019                      | 2018                      | 2017                      | |                                                                                                                                   | (In millions)             | (In millions)             | (In millions)             | | Net cash from operating activities                                                                                                | $ 1,869                   | $ 1,845                   | $ 1,677                   |\n\n| Net cash used in investing activities                                                                                             | (1,172 )                  | (1,212 )                  | (1,468 )                  | |Excluding:                                                                                                                        |                           |                           |                           | | Payment for purchase and proceeds from sale of  marketable securities, and net cash variation for  joint ventures deconsolidation | (200 )                    | (100 )                    | 99                        || Payment for purchase and proceeds from sale of  tangible and intangible assets, payment for  business acquisitions (1)            | (1,372 )                  | (1,312 )                  | (1,369 )                  | |Free Cash Flow (non-U.S. GAAP measure)                                                                                            | $ 497                     | $ 533                     | $ 308                     |\n\nFree Cash Flow was positive $497 million in 2019, compared to positive $533 million and positive $308 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.",

uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities.Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, consisting of net loss of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $26.2 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million.Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $16.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $10.0 million.The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an outflow from the changes in accrued liabilities and other of $5.9 million and inventory of $5.6 million, partially offset by an inflow from changes in deferred revenue of $3.2 million.\n\nThe unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and other was driven by an increase in lease liabilities associated with the lease of the San Jose corporate office.The unfavorable change in inventory was due to build up of inventory and timing of shipments, partially offset by increased reserves.The favorable change in deferred revenues was primarily driven by increased bookings.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million, consisting of net loss of $27.6 million which includes payments for our internal investigation costs of $8.6 million, non-cash charges of $25.0 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million.Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.9 million.The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $3.1 million, offset primarily by an outflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $6.1 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and inventory of $1.5 million.\n\nThe favorable change in deferred revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the sale of subscription and support.The favorable change in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, increased value added tax accrual due to timing of payments, and an increase in legal fees accrual.The unfavorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections.The unfavorable change in prepaid and other assets was mainly driven by the increase in deferred sales commissions due to higher deferred revenue and higher average commission rate.The unfavorable change in inventory was due to the timing of shipments.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $14.3 million, consisting of a net loss of $10.8 million, a cash decrease resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million and non-cash charges of $26.4 million.Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $17.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance of $1.1 million.The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $12.4 million and deferred revenue of $3.0 million, and an outflow from the change in accrued liabilities of $8.9 million, inventory of $4.7 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and accounts payable of $0.9 million."

the \"Direct Purchaser Putative Class Action\", the \"Indirect Purchaser Putative Class Action\" and the \"Non-Class Cases.\"\n\nThe Direct Purchaser Putative Class Action.The named plaintiffs in these cases alleged that they purchased eggs or egg products directly from a defendant and sued on behalf of themselves and a putative class of others who claimed to be similarly situated.As previously reported, in November 2014, the District Court approved the Company's settlement with the direct purchaser plaintiff class and entered final judgment dismissing with prejudice the class members' claims against the Company.\n\nThe Indirect Purchaser Putative Class Action.The named plaintiffs in these cases are individuals or companies who allege that they purchased shell eggs indirectly from one or more of the defendants - that is, they purchased from retailers that had previously purchased from defendants or other parties - and sued on behalf of themselves and a putative class of others who claim to be similarly situated.The District Court denied the indirect purchaser plaintiffs' motion for class certification.On June 28, 2018, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the indirect purchaser plaintiffs, for an immaterial amount, and on July 17, 2018, the Court entered an order dismissing all indirect purchaser plaintiffs' claims against the Company and other defendants.\n\nThe Non-Class Cases.In the remaining cases, the named plaintiffs allege that they purchased shell eggs and egg products directly from one or more of the defendants but sue only for their own alleged damages and not on behalf of a putative class.On April 4, 2018, the Court entered a final judgement dismissing all claims against the Company brought by the following non-class plaintiffs: The Kroger Co.; Publix Super Markets, Inc.; SUPERVALU, Inc.; Safeway, Inc.; Albertsons LLC; H.E. Butt Grocery Co.; The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, Inc.; Walgreen Co.; HyVee, Inc.; and Giant Eagle, Inc., with prejudice, pursuant to the Company's previously announced $80.8 million settlement with the named plaintiffs.\n\nThe Company settled all Non-Class cases except for the claims of certain plaintiffs who sought substantial damages allegedly arising from the purchase of egg products (as opposed to shell eggs).As previously reported, the Company settled all claims brought by one of these plaintiffs, Conopco, Inc. on a confidential basis and for an amount that did not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results, and on November 21, 2018, the Court entered a final judgment dismissing Conopco's claims against the Company.The remaining plaintiffs are Kraft Food Global, Inc., General Mills, Inc., Nestle USA, Inc., and The Kellogg Company (\"Egg Products Plaintiffs\").The Egg Products Plaintiffs seek treble damages and injunctive relief under the Sherman Act and are attacking certain features of the UEP animal-welfare guidelines and program used by the Company and many other egg producers.On September 6, 2016, the District Court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment and dismissed with prejudice all claims based on the purchase of egg products.That ruling was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third"
