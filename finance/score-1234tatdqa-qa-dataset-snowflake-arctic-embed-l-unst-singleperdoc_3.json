discount rate was determined by comparison against the FTSE pension liability index for AA rated corporate instruments.The Company monitors other indices to assure that the pension obligations are fairly reported on a consistent basis.The international discount rates were determined by comparison against country specific AA corporate indices, adjusted for duration of the obligation.\n\nThe periodic benefit cost and the actuarial present value of projected benefit obligations are based on actuarial assumptions that are reviewed on an annual basis.The Company revises these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of longterm trends, as well as market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits.","## Benefit Obligations\n\nThe act u arial ass u

options exercised in 2019 was 445.0p (2018: n\/a).The PSP awards outstanding at 31 March 2019 have a weighted average remaining vesting period of 0.8 years (2018: 1.2 years) and a weighted average contractual life of 7.6 years (2018: 8.2 years).\n\n## Deferred Annual Bonus and Single Incentive Plan\n\nThe Group operates the Deferred Annual Bonus and Single Incentive Plan for the Operational Leadership Team and certain key employees.The Plan consists of two schemes, the Deferred Annual ('DAB') and the Single Incentive Plan Award ('SIPA').\n\n## Deferred Annual Bonus\n\nThe Group operates a Deferred Annual scheme ('DABP') for Executive Directors and certain key senior executives.Awards under the plan are contingent on the satisfaction of pre-set internal targets relating to financial and operational objectives.Awards have a vesting period of two years from the date of the award (the 'Vesting Period') and are potentially forfeitable during that period should the employee leave employment.The DABP awards have been valued using the Black-Scholes method and the resulting share-based payments charge is being spread evenly over the combined Performance Period and Vesting Period of the shares, being three years.\n\nOn 16 June 2018, the Group awarded 71,552 nil cost options under the DABP scheme.The assumptions used in the measurement of the fair value at grant date of the DABP awards are as follows:\n\n| Grant date     |   Share price at  grant date  \u00a3 | Exercise  price  \u00a3   |   Option  life  years |   Risk-free  rate  %|   Dividend  yield  % |   Non-vesting

established a Share Incentive Plan ('SIP').All eligible employees were awarded free shares (or nil-cost options in the case of employees in Ireland) valued at \u00a33,600 each based on the share price at the time of the Company's admission to the Stock Exchange in March 2015, subject to a three-year service period ('Vesting Period').The SIP shareholders are entitled to dividends over the Vesting Period.There are no performance conditions applicable to the vesting of SIP shares.The fair value of the SIP awards at the grant date was measured to be \u00a32.72 using the Black-Scholes model.The resulting share-based payments charge is being spread evenly over the Vesting Period.\n\n## UK SIP\n\n|                                    | 2019 Number   | 2018 Number   |

relate to those attributable to good leavers as defined by the scheme rules.\n\n## Performance Share Plan\n\nThe Group operates a Performance Share Plan ('PSP') for Executive Directors, the Operating Leadership Team and certain key employees.The extent to which awards vest will depend upon the Group's performance over the three-year period following the award date.Both market based and non-market based performance conditions may be attached to the options, for which an appropriate adjustment is made when calculating the fair value of an option.If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest, unless under exceptional circumstances.\n\nOn 17 August 2018, the Group awarded 452,695 nil cost options under the PSP scheme.For the 2018 awards, the Group's performance is measured by reference to the growth in Operating profit (75% of the award) and growth in Revenue (25% of the award) over the three-year period April 2018 - March 2021.For previous awards, the Group's performance had been measured by reference to the cumulative profit measure (Underlying operating profit for 2015 and 2016 awards, and Operating profit for 2017 awards) and total shareholder return relative to the FTSE 250 share index.\n\n120 |"],"2":["## Share\n\nBased

respectively.\n\n## Stock Options with Time-based Vesting Criteria\n\nIn November 2017, we granted 10,924 incentive stock options and 69,076 non-qualified stock options with a total grant date fair value of$17.55 per share, o r $1.4 million.These stock options were valued using a Black-Scholes model, using a volatility rate of45.7%, a risk-free rate of 2.21%, a strike price of $36.61 and an expected term of 6.5 years.Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period which approximated 4.5 years for these awards.These awards were included in the cancellation during the fiscal first quarter of2019 as discussed in the section below.\n\n## Stock Options with Market-based Vesting Criteria\n\nWe grant NQs that are subject to vesting only upon the market price of our underlying public stock closing above a certain price target withinseven years of the date of grant.Share-based compensation expense is recognized regardless of the number of awards that are earned based on the market condition and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated service period of approximately three years.If the required service period is not met for these options, then the share-based compensation expense would be reversed.In the event that our common stock achieves the target price per share based on a 30-day trailing average prior to the end of the estimated service period, any remaining unamortized compensation cost will be recognized.\n\nStock options with market-based vesting criteria granted for fiscal years2019, 2018 and 2017 were 585,000, 325,000 and 320,000, respectively, at weighted average grant date fair values of $7.47, $15.52 and $13.18 per share, or total grant date fair value $2.4 million, $5.0 million and $4.3 million, respectively.\n\nThese NQs with market-based vesting criteria were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model.The weighted average Monte Carlo input assumptions used for calculating the fair value of these market-based stock options are as follows:\n\n|                         | Fiscal Years   | Fiscal Years   | Fiscal Years   |

748,328 PRSUs for 13 employees, which was accounted for as a modification.The incremental compensation cost resulting from the modification was $8.2 million, and was being recognized as share-based compensation expense over the requisite service period of three years for the new PRSU awards.As a result of subsequent actions that resulted in forfeitures, the remaining compensation expense associated with this modification as of September 27, 2019 is $2.8 million.\n\n## Restricted Stock Awards and Units\n\nA summary of restricted stock awards and units activity for fiscal year2019 is as

was $56.3 million for fiscal year 2019.The total fair value of restricted stock awards and units vested was$11.7 million, $19.7 million and $51.2 million for the fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.RSUs granted generally vest over a period offour years.\n\nIn addition to RSUs, we also issue PRSUs with specific performance vesting criteria.These PRSUs have both a service and performance-based vesting condition and awards are divided into three equal tranches and vest based on achieving certain adjusted earnings per share growth metrics.The service condition requires participants to be employed on May 15th of the following year once the performance condition has been met.Depending on the actual performance achieved, a participant may earn between 0% to 300% of the targeted shares for each tranche, which is determined based on a straight-line interpolation applied for the achievement between the specified performance ranges.As of September 27, 2019, the performance condition targets for awards with future service conditions had not been met.We granted 1,005,854 PRSUs during fiscal year 2019 and 745,047 were forfeited.The amount of incremental PRSU awards that could ultimately vest if all performance criteria are achieved would be 1,196,337 shares assuming a maximum of 300% of the targeted shares.\n\nWe granted 200,000 market-based RSUs during fiscal year 2019, at a weighted average grant date fair value of$17.65 per share, and a total fair value of $3.5 million.Recipients may earn between0% and 150% of the target number of shares based on the Company's achievement of total shareholder return in comparison to a peer group of companies in the Nasdaq composite index over a period of approximately three years.The fair value of the awards was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation and compensation expense is recognized ratably over the service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards of $3.5 million subject to the market condition.The expected volatility of the Company's common stock was estimated based on the historical average volatility rate over the three-year period.The dividend yield assumption was based on historical and anticipated dividend payouts.The risk-free rate assumption was based on observed interest rates consistent with the three-year measurement period.The assumptions used to value the awards are as follows:","## Share\n\nBased Compensation\n\nThe following table shows a summary of share-based compensation expense included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the

exercise price of outstanding, in-themoney options.The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $0.7 million, $0.9 million and $8.9 million for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\n## Stock Options with Time-based Vesting Criteria\n\nIn November 2017, we granted 10,924 incentive stock options and 69,076 non-qualified stock options with a total grant date fair value of$17.55 per share, o r $1.4 million.These stock options were valued using a Black-Scholes model, using a volatility rate of45.7%, a risk-free rate of 2.21%, a strike price of $36.61 and an expected term of 6.5 years.Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period which approximated 4.5 years for these awards.These awards were included in the cancellation during the fiscal first quarter of2019 as discussed in the section below.\n\n## Stock Options with Market-based Vesting Criteria\n\nWe grant NQs that are subject to vesting only upon the market price of our underlying public stock closing above a certain price target withinseven years of the date of grant.Share-based compensation expense is recognized regardless of the number of awards that are earned based on the market condition and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated service period of approximately three years.If the required service period is not met for these options, then the share-based compensation expense would be reversed.In the event that our common stock achieves the target price per share based on a 30-day trailing average prior to the end of the estimated service period, any remaining unamortized compensation cost will be recognized.\n\nStock options with market-based vesting criteria granted for fiscal years2019, 2018 and 2017 were 585,000, 325,000 and 320,000, respectively, at weighted average grant date fair values of $7.47, $15.52 and $13.18 per share, or total grant date fair value $2.4 million, $5.0 million and $4.3
