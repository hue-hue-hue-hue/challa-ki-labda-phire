uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities.Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, consisting of net loss of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $26.2 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million.Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $16.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $10.0 million.The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an outflow from the changes in accrued liabilities and other of $5.9 million and inventory of $5.6 million, partially offset by an inflow from changes in deferred revenue of $3.2 million.\n\nThe unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and other was driven by an increase in lease liabilities associated with the lease of the San Jose corporate office.The unfavorable change in inventory was due to build up of inventory and timing of shipments, partially offset by increased reserves.The favorable change in deferred revenues was primarily driven by increased bookings.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million, consisting of net loss of $27.6 million which includes payments for our internal investigation costs of $8.6 million, non-cash charges of $25.0 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million.Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.9 million.The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $3.1 million, offset primarily by an outflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $6.1 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and inventory of $1.5 million.\n\nThe favorable change in deferred revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the sale of subscription and support.The favorable change in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, increased value added tax accrual due to timing of payments, and an increase in legal fees accrual.The unfavorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections.The unfavorable change in prepaid and other assets was mainly driven by the increase in deferred sales commissions due to higher deferred revenue and higher average commission rate.The unfavorable change in inventory was due to the timing of shipments.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $14.3 million, consisting of a net loss of $10.8 million, a cash decrease resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million and non-cash charges of $26.4 million.Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $17.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance of $1.1 million.The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $12.4 million and deferred revenue of $3.0 million, and an outflow from the change in accrued liabilities of $8.9 million, inventory of $4.7 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and accounts payable of $0.9 million.","## Index to Financial Statements\n\n## Item 6.Selected Financial Data\n\nThe following table sets forth selected financial data as of and for our

proprietary technology to deliver the services.Services revenue is also comprised of licensing of our Support.com Cloud applications.Services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by $4.9 million from 2018.The decrease in service revenue was primarily due to the decrease in the billable hours of our major customers.For the year ended December 31, 2019, services revenue generated from our partnerships was $56.6 million compared to $61.0 million for 2018.For the year ended December 31, 2019, direct services revenue was $2.9 million compared to $3.5 million for 2018.As with any market that is undergoing shifts, timing of downward pressures and growth opportunities in our services programs are difficult to predict.We are experiencing downward pressure with some of our services programs as pers onal computer and certain retail markets are subject to internal re-alignment and other sector specific softness.H owever, we still see opportunity in the market for growth with our service partners as a result of the evolving support market trends.","## Results of Operations\n\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of revenue for certain items in our statements

in 2019 was primarily due to lower sales from Display Bridge Solution, eFPGA license and connectivity product, which was partially offset by an increase in AI SaaS revenue.The increase in mature product revenue was due primarily to increased orders from our customers in the defense, aerospace, test and instrumentation sectors.\n\nGross Profit.The table below sets forth the changes in gross

number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans for our employees.The Group's largest defined benefit scheme is in the UK.For further details see \"Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\" in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nFor defined benefit retirement plans, the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the plan liabilities is recognised as an asset or liability on the statement of financial position.Scheme liabilities are assessed using the projected unit funding method and applying the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting period date.Assets are valued at market value.\n\nActuarial gains and losses are taken to the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.For this purpose, actuarial gains and losses comprise both the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising from differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred.The return on plan assets, in excess of interest income, and costs incurred for the management of plan assets are also taken to other comprehensive income.\n\nOther movements in the net surplus or deficit are recognised in the income statement, including the current service cost, any past service cost and the effect of any settlements.The interest cost less the expected interest income on assets is also charged to the income statement.The amount charged to the income statement in respect of these plans is included within operating costs or in the Group's share of the results of equity accounted operations, as appropriate.\n\nThe Group's contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the income statement as they fall due.\n\n## Background\n\nAt 31 March 2019 the Group operated a number of pension plans for the benefit of its employees throughout the world, with varying rights and obligations depending on the conditions and practices in the countries concerned.The Group's pension plans are provided through both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements.Defined benefit schemes provide benefits based on the employees' length of pensionable service and their final pensionable salary or other criteria.Defined contribution schemes offer employees individual funds that are converted into benefits at the time of retirement.\n\nThe Group operates defined benefit schemes in Germany, Ghana, India, Ireland, Italy, the UK, the United States and the Group operates defined benefit indemnity plans in Greece and Turkey.Defined contribution pension schemes are currently provided in Egypt, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Portugal, South Africa, Spain and the UK.\n\n## Income statement expense\n\n|                                                    |   2019  \u20acm |   2018  \u20acm |   2017  \u20acm |

schemes\n\nThe Group's retirement policy is to provide competitive pension provision, in each operating country, in line with the market median for that location.The Group's preferred retirement provision is focused on Defined Contribution ('DC') arrangements and\/or State provision for future service.\n\nThe Group's main defined benefit funding liability is the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme ('Vodafone UK plan').Since June 2014 the plan has consisted of two segregated sections: the Vodafone Section and the Cable & Wireless Section ('CWW Section').Both sections are closed to new entrants and to future accrual.The Group also operates smaller funded and unfunded plans in the UK, funded and unfunded plans in Germany and funded plans in Ireland.Defined benefit pension provision exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as longer than expected longevity of participants, lower than expected return on investments and higher than expected inflation, which may increase the liabilities or reduce the value of assets of the schemes.\n\nThe main defined benefit schemes are administered by trustee boards which are legally separate from the Group and consist of representatives who are employees, former employees or are independent from the Company.The boards of the pension schemes are required by legislation to act in the best interest of the participants, set the investment strategy and contribution rates and are subject to statutory funding objectives.\n\nThe Vodafone UK plan is registered as an occupational pension plan with HM Revenue and Customs ('HMRC') and is subject to UK legislation and operates within the framework outlined by the Pensions Regulator.UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently and that valuations are undertaken at least every three years.Separate valuations are required for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section.\n\nThe trustees obtain regular actuarial valuations to check whether the statutory funding objective is met and whether a recovery plan is required to restore funding to the level of the agreed technical provisions.On 19 October 2017, the 31 March 2016 triennial actuarial valuation for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section of the Vodafone UK plan, which is used to judge the funding the Group needs to put into the scheme, was concluded."]},"response":{"0":"The table includes data
