determined that credit risk largely depends on both the risk in the country where the customer resides (e.g. ability to make cross border payments) as well as the payment pattern of the customer.Therefore, expected credit losses (ECLs) are calculated using a provision matrix that specifies a fixed rate depending both on the number of days past due and the country risk rating.The country risk ratings depends on the ratings used by all Export Credit Agencies within the OECD.The rates defined in the provision matrix are based on historical loss patterns for that grouping of customers.These rates are adjusted for current conditions as well as management expectations for changes to political risks and payment patterns in the future.The provision rates are higher on high risk countries compared to low risk countries and also higher on amounts that remain unpaid for longer periods of time.There were no significant changes to the model during the year.\n\nTrade receivables and contract assets together amounted to SEK 55,240 (64,350) million as of December 31, 2019.Provisions for expected credit losses on trade receivables and contract assets amounted to SEK 2,983 (4,123) million as of December 31, 2019.The allowance decreased in 2019 due to improvement in cash collection resulting in significant reduction of total past due invoices.The Company's write-offs have historically been low.During the year SEK 382 (890) million were written off due to the Company having no reasonable expectation of collection.Of these write-offs, SEK 0 (61) million are still subject to enforcement.\n\n## Movements in allowances for impairment of trade receivables and contract assets\n\n|                                        | 2019   | 2018   |

customers represented 49% (53%) of the total trade receivables and contract assets in 2019.\n\n| Aging analysis of gross values by risk category at December 31, 2019   | Aging analysis of gross values

procedure for the Board of Directors and according to the established credit approval process.\n\nPrior to the approval of new facilities reported as customer finance, an internal credit risk assessment is conducted in order to assess the credit rating of each transaction for political and commercial risk.The credit risk analysis is made by using an assessment tool, where the political risk rating is identical to the rating used by all Export Credit Agencies within the OECD.The commercial risk is assessed by analyzing a large number of parameters, which may affect the level of the future commercial credit risk exposure.The output from the assessment tool for the credit rating also includes an internal pricing of the risk.This is expressed as a risk margin per annum over funding cost.The reference pricing for political and commercial risk, on which the tool is based, is reviewed using information from Export Credit Agencies and prevailing pricing in the bank loan and bond markets for structured financed deals.The objective is that the internally set risk margin shall reflect the assessed risk and that the pricing is as close as possible to the current market pricing.A reassessment of the credit rating for each customer finance facility is made on a regular basis.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, the total amount payable to the Company under customer finance credits was SEK 5,924 (4,247) million.The carrying value of these assets was SEK 3,756 (2,883) million as of December 31, 2019, which represents the maximum exposure to credit risk on these assets.Customer finance is arranged for infrastructure projects in different geographic markets.As of December 31, 2019, there were a total of 80 (94) customer finance arrangements originated by or guaranteed by the Company.The five largest facilities represented 69% (62%) of the customer finance exposure in 2019.As of December 31, 2019, Middle East and Africa made up 49% (57%) of the oustanding exposure while South East Asia, Oceania and India made up 29% (15%).As of December 31, 2019, the Company also had unutilized customer finance commitments of SEK 25,854 (30,270) million.\n\nSecurity arrangements for customer finance facilities may include pledges of equipment, pledges of certain assets belonging to the borrower and pledges of shares in the operating company.If available, third-party risk coverage is, as a rule, arranged.\"Third-party risk coverage\" means that a financial payment guarantee covering the credit risk has been issued by a bank, an export credit agency or an insurance company.All such institutions have been rated at least investment grade.A credit risk transfer under a sub-participation arrangement with a bank can also be arranged.In this case the entire credit risk and the funding is taken care of by the bank for the part that they cover.\n\nInformation about financial guarantees related to customer finance is included in note D2, \"Contingent liabilities.\"\n\nThe table below summarizes the Company's outstanding customer finance as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\n## Outstanding customer finance credit risk exposure 1)\n\n|

coverage | 3,485  | 2,615  |\n\n1)This table has been adjusted to show the maximum exposure to credit risk.\n\n## Fair value assessment of customer finance credits\n\nCustomer finance risk exposures are held at fair value and are classified as Level 3 on the fair value hierarchy.The Credit Asset Management Team within Ericsson Credit AB, reporting to Head of Group Treasury and Customer Finance, has established a process with respect to measurement of fair values.The quarterly credit review uses an internal model to determine a commercial rating for each credit and for calculation of the fair value.The model is based on external credit rating, political\/country rating and bank pricing.Regular monitoring of customer behavior is also a part of the internal assessment.Revaluation of customer finance amounted to a net negative impact in the income statement of SEK 804 (1,073) million in 2019, of which SEK 804 (1,073) million is related to credits held as of December 31, 2019.This effect is presented within selling and administrative expenses and was mainly related to India and the Middle East, especially Iran and Iraq.\n\n## Customer finance fair value reconciliation\n\n|

customer finance receivables remains low.","| (In millions)                                                | Revised Preliminary  Allocation  As of August 1, 2019   | Measurement  Period  Adjustments

liability is primarily attributable to the Company's decision to take bonus depreciation on qualifying assets placed in service during fiscal 2019.\n\nIncluded in the deferred tax assets at October 31, 2019, is a federal NOL carryforward of $255.4 million.All of the NOL carryforward was incurred subsequent to the enactment of the TCJA and therefore has an indefinite carryforward period.The Company has significant deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to property, plant and equipment, which are expected to reverse and allow for the full utilization of the NOL carryforward.As such, the Company has not recorded a valuation allowance related to the NOL carryforward.Also included in the deferred tax assets are North Carolina Investing in Business Property Credit and North Carolina Jobs Credits totaling $4.9 million, as well as Georgia Job Tax Credits totaling $2.6 million.The North Carolina Investing in Business Property Credit provides a 7% investment tax credit for property located in a North Carolina development area, the North Carolina Creating Jobs Credit provides a tax credit for increased employment in North Carolina, and the Georgia Job Tax Credit provides a tax credit for creation and retention of qualifying jobs in Georgia.It is management's opinion that the majority of the North Carolina and Georgia income tax credits will not be utilized before they expire, and a $5.6 million valuation allowance has been recorded as of October 31, 2019.The North Carolina credits began to expire during fiscal 2018, and the remaining credits expire between fiscal years 2020 and 2023.","## Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\n\nSignificant components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are summarized below (in thousands):\n\n|

the Company's historical operating income, projection of future taxable income, scheduled reversal of taxable temporary differences, and tax planning strategies, management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances recorded.The net increase in the total valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 is primarily related to the increase of a net operating loss carry forward due to a release of a non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefit and the increase of deferred tax assets in sites with existing valuation allowances.The decrease in domestic federal and state tax credits is primarily related to the utilization of tax credits against the one-time transition tax.\n\nAs of August 31, 2019, the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the remaining earnings from its foreign subsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not already been recorded.The accumulated earnings are the most significant component of the basis difference which is indefinitely reinvested.As of August 31, 2019, the indefinitely reinvested earnings in foreign subsidiaries upon which taxes had not been provided were approximately $1.9 billion.The estimated amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these reinvested earnings was approximately $0.2 billion."]},"response":{"0":"As of
