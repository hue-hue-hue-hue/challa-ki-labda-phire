The interest cost less the expected interest income on assets is also charged to the income statement. The amount charged to the income statement in respect of these plans is included within operating costs or in the Group’s share of the results of equity accounted operations, as appropriate.\n\nThe Group’s contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the income statement as they fall due.\n\nBackground At 31 March 2019 the Group operated a number of pension plans for the benefit of its employees throughout the world, with varying rights and obligations depending on the conditions and practices in the countries concerned. The Group’s pension plans are provided through both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements. Defined benefit schemes provide benefits based on the employees’ length of pensionable service and their final pensionable salary or other criteria. Defined contribution schemes offer employees individual funds that are converted into benefits at the time of retirement.\n\nThe Group operates defined benefit schemes in Germany, Ghana, India, Ireland, Italy, the UK, the United States and the Group operates defined benefit indemnity plans in Greece and Turkey. Defined contribution pension schemes are currently provided in Egypt, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Portugal, South Africa, Spain and the UK.\n\nIncome statement expense\n\nDefined contribution schemes Defined benefit schemes Total amount charged to income statement (note 23)\n\n2019 €m 166 57 223\n\n2018 €m 178 44 222\n\n2017 €m 192 20 212\n\nDefined benefit schemes The Group’s retirement policy is to provide competitive pension provision, in each operating country, in line with the market median for that location. The Group’s preferred retirement provision is focused on Defined Contribution (‘DC’) arrangements and/or State provision for future service.\n\nThe Group’s main defined benefit funding liability is the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme (‘Vodafone UK plan’). Since June 2014 the plan has consisted of two segregated sections: the Vodafone Section and the Cable & Wireless Section (‘CWW Section’). Both sections are closed to new entrants and to future accrual. The Group also operates smaller funded and unfunded plans in the UK, funded and unfunded plans in Germany and funded plans in Ireland. Defined benefit pension provision exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as longer than expected longevity of participants, lower than expected return on investments and higher than expected inflation, which may increase the liabilities or reduce the value of assets of the schemes.\n\nThe main defined benefit schemes are administered by trustee boards which are legally separate from the Group and consist of representatives who are employees, former employees or are independent from the Company. The boards of the pension schemes are required by legislation to act in the best interest of the participants, set the investment strategy and contribution rates and are subject to statutory funding objectives.\n\nThe Vodafone UK plan is registered as an occupational pension plan with HM Revenue and Customs (‘HMRC’) and is subject to UK legislation and operates within the framework outlined by the Pensions Regulator. UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently and that valuations are undertaken at least every three years. Separate valuations are required for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section.\n\nThe trustees obtain regular actuarial valuations to check whether the statutory funding objective is met and whether a recovery plan is required to restore funding to the level of the agreed technical provisions. On 19 October 2017, the 31 March 2016 triennial actuarial valuation for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section of the Vodafone UK plan, which is used to judge the funding the Group needs to put into the scheme, was concluded."

The volatility is a measure of the amount by which the Company’s share price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate; the Company used its common stock volatility along with the average of historic volatilities of comparative companies. The dividend yield is zero as the Company has not made any dividend payment and has no plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.

In conjunction with the changes to reporting units, we reassigned goodwill between CGD and CMS based on their relative fair values on October 1, 2017.\n\nIn July 2017, we acquired Deltenna, a wireless infrastructure company specializing in the design and delivery of radio and antenna communication solutions. Deltenna’s operations were included in our CGD reporting unit upon its acquisition. On April 1, 2019, we reorganized our reporting structure to include Deltenna in our CMS reporting unit and reassigned $3.4 million of goodwill from CGD to CMS based upon its relative fair value. Since its acquisition, Deltenna’s sales, operating results, and cash flows have not been significant to our consolidated results. As such, reportable segment information has not been restated for this change in the composition of our reportable segments.\n\nWe complete our annual goodwill impairment test each year as of July 1 separately for our CTS, CGD and CMS reporting units.\n\nThe test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process. The first step of the test is performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including recorded goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment, if any, by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount. Any resulting impairment determined would be recorded in the current period.\n\nFor our 2019 impairment test, the estimated fair value of all three of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts. As such, there was no impairment of goodwill in 2019.\n\nSignificant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that are used in our impairment analysis. The estimates we used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business. Although we believe our underlying assumptions supporting these assessments are reasonable, if our forecasted sales and margin growth rates, timing of growth, or the discount rate vary from our forecasts, we may be required to perform interim analyses in fiscal 2020 that could expose us to material impairment charges in the future.\n\n107\n\nTotal\n\n"

            "We measure and report our annual scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions. As part of our commitment to reduce our Greenhouse Gas (‘GHG’) emissions, we moved to a certified green tariff renewable electricity supply contract for our UK operations from the beginning of the financial year.\n\nThe GHG emissions summary below shows our gross emissions including location-based scope 2 emissions, as well as our net emissions accounting for the market-based scope 2 reporting for our certified green electricity tariff.\n\nThe reduction in emissions is driven by continued progress in energy efficiency, a reduction in emissions associated with refrigerants as we continue to move away from fluorinated gas refrigerants, and the general reduction in UK grid carbon factor as more renewables make up a greater proportion of the fuel mix.\n\nReducing packaging and plastics Packaging and plastic have played a vital role in safe food storage and distribution for decades, but now our approach to their use is changing. We work with our customers to look for the best packaging solutions for all our products, that take into account the environmental impact, while keeping our food fresher for longer. We are committed to working with our customers to reducing our use of single-use plastics and partnering with suppliers to find effective alternatives.\n\nWe support the UK Plastics Pact and are committed to meeting its 2025 targets. We will monitor and reduce the amount of plastics used to transport and consume our products, and we aim to develop a circular system whereby plastic is used less and kept out of the environment. Throughout FY19, we have engaged with all key customers and have plans to remove remaining ‘hard to recycle’ packaging as soon as possible.\n\nOver the last six years, we have made good progress in our water consumption per tonne of product, reducing it by 15% over the period. There was also a significant improvement in FY19, and one of the contributing factors to the improvement was the closure of the Evercreech desserts facility which had a higher water intensity than most sites within the business.\n\nWater consumption per tonne of product – UK manufacturing (m3 per tonne)\n\nIn FY19, we saved 18.7 tonnes of plastic by replacing the black plastic trays in a ready meal range with foil. Activities targeting relatively small pieces of plastic such as ‘windows’ on quiche boxes have also led to significant reductions in plastic use.\n\nWe have recycled 758 tonnes of plastic from our manufacturing and distribution activities in FY19 and have identified opportunities for further improvements in the future.\n\nFY19\n\n5.91\n\nFY18\n\n6.45\n\nPrimary energy consumption per tonne of product – UK manufacturing (kWhp per tonne)\n\nFY19\n\n1,235\n\nFY18\n\n1,299\n\nEmissions are summarised below, all reported as CO2 equivalent (‘CO2e’) Emissions from:\n\nEmissions reported in tonnes CO2e* FY19**\n\nFY18**\n\nFY18***\n\nCombustion of fuel and operation of facilities (Scope 1)\n\n59,495\n\n66,336\n\n75,600\n\nElectricity, heat, steam and cooling purchased for own use (Scope 2)\n\n27,633\n\n32,389\n\n67,754\n\nTotal gross emissions (Scope 1 and 2)\n\n87,128\n\n98,725\n\n143,354\n\nGreen tariff\n\n27,603\n\n0\n\n0\n\nTotal net emissions (Scope 1 and 2)\n\n59,525\n\n98,725\n\n143,354\n\nRatio (KgCO2e per £1 sales revenue)\n\n0.060\n\n0.066\n\n0.056\n\nOur GHG emissions have been calculated using the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, and emissions factors from DEFRA’s\n\nUK government GHG conversion factors for company reporting (where factors have not been provided directly by a supplier).\n\n** UK & Ireland only – comparable with FY19 Group structure. *** Full Group including US business.\n\nAnnual Report and Financial Statements 2019\n\n",

This has been primarily driven by our efficiency initiatives delivering strong energy reductions in North America and APAC. There was an increase in energy use in EMEA, driven by the opening of new sites in the UK and Finland, and an increase in energy use at our site in Paris. Gas use also increased in the year by 7 per cent, with all sites seeing similar increases over 2018.\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions Spirent is committed to acting to combat climate change and reporting its progress. Our total Scope 1 and 2 emissions dropped by 6.14 per cent from 2018, and our emissions per $ million of revenue were down by 10.9 per cent. We have reduced our total emissions by 29 per cent since our 2014 baseline.\n\nThe Group responded to the Carbon Disclosure Project in 2019, completing the Climate Change and Supply Chain questionnaires. In 2019 we achieved a Climate Change rating of B (management) (2018 C) and a Supplier Engagement rating of B (management) (2018 B). The average for our sector is C in both categories.\n\nMethodology Reporting on emission sources is required under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors Report) Regulations 2013 and these sources fall within our consolidated financial statements. We have reported on all the emission sources that fall within our consolidated financial statements. We do not have any responsibility for any emission sources that are not included in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe have used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition), along with data gathered to fulfil our requirements under these Regulations, and the most recent emission factors available: UK Government’s GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2019 for the UK, US EPA 2018 eGrid emissions factors for the applicable individual states in the US, and 2018 emissions factors for all other countries were sourced from the International Energy Agency’s 2019 data set.\n\nPerformance against target The Group set a target to reduce carbon emissions by five per cent relative to revenue from 2018 figures. We have achieved this target, having reduced carbon emissions per $million of revenue by 10.9 per cent.\n\nCompliance The Group is not required to comply with stages 1 or 2 of the UK Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (ESOS) Regulations 2014.\n\nProcurement Vendor assessment and auditing Vendors are required to abide by our Code of Conduct which sets out our expectations for environmental management, labour and human rights, health and safety, and business ethics. They are assessed using a detailed questionnaire.\n\nIn addition, priority suppliers are audited by Spirent’s procurement team: 22 supplier audits were conducted in 2019, representing 88.7 per cent of our hardware supply chain spend. This exceeded our target of completing 18 audits in the year. No material issues were identified.\n\nCompliance We comply with the requirements of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act 2010. We require slavery and human trafficking to be eradicated from our direct supply chain for the products we sell and monitor suppliers by performing regular evaluation surveys to assure ourselves of each supplier’s commitment in this area.\n\nSpirent’s full statement on Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking can be found on the Company’s website at https://corporate.spirent.com.\n\nSpirent Communications plc Annual Report 2019\n\n",

The key drivers of\n\nchanges in our operating metrics are presented in the order of significance.\n\nNet bookings and In-game net bookings\n\nWe monitor net bookings as a key operating metric in evaluating the performance of our business because it enables an analysis of performance based on the timing of actual transactions with our customers and provides more timely indication of trends in our operating results. Net bookings is the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period, and includes license fees, merchandise, and publisher incentives, among others. Net bookings is equal to net revenues excluding the impact from deferrals. In-game net bookings primarily includes the net amount of downloadable content and microtransactions sold during the period, and is equal to in-game net revenues excluding the impact from deferrals.\n\nNet bookings and in-game net bookings were as follows (amounts in millions):\n\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nIncrease (Decrease)\n\nNet bookings\n\n$\n\n6,388\n\n$\n\n7,262\n\n$\n\nIn-game net bookings\n\n$\n\n3,366\n\n$\n\n4,203\n\n$\n\nNet bookings\n\nThe decrease in net bookings for 2019, as compared to 2018, was primarily due to:\n\n\n\na $572 million decrease in Blizzard net bookings primarily driven by (1) lower net bookings from Hearthstone and (2) overall lower net bookings from World of Warcraft expansion and in-game content sales, primarily due to World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth, which was released in August 2018, with no comparable release in 2019 (although net bookings from subscriptions increased due to the release of World of Warcraft Classic in August 2019);\n\n\n\na $239 million decrease in Activision net bookings primarily driven by (1) lower net bookings from the Destiny franchise (reflecting our sale of the publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie in December 2018) and (2) lower net bookings from Call of Duty franchise catalog titles, partially offset by net bookings from Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled, and Call of Duty: Mobile, which were new releases in March 2019, June 2019, and October 2019, respectively; and\n\n33\n\n33\n\n",

Normalised CODB as a percentage of sales grew 64 bps, driven by a $21 million impairment charge related to goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the Summergate business in China. Summergate has now transitioned to ExportCo. Excluding Summergate, normalised CODB as a percentage of sales increased by 40 bps due to above‐inflationary cost pressures, as well as targeted investment in key focus areas including customer experience, ranging, data and analytics. Endeavour Drinks EBIT for F19 decreased 8.2% to $474 million. EBIT normalised for the 53rd week and Summergate impairment of $21 million decreased 5.6%.

            "172 Vodafone Group Plc\n\nAnnual Report 2019\n\n24. Post employment benefits\n\nThe Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans for our employees. The Group’s largest defined benefit scheme is in the UK. For further details see “Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty” in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAccounting policies For defined benefit retirement plans, the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the plan liabilities is recognised as an asset or liability on the statement of financial position. Scheme liabilities are assessed using the projected unit funding method and applying the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting period date. Assets are valued at market value.\n\nActuarial gains and losses are taken to the statement of comprehensive income as incurred. For this purpose, actuarial gains and losses comprise both the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising from differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred. The return on plan assets, in excess of interest income, and costs incurred for the management of plan assets are also taken to other comprehensive income.\n\nOther movements in the net surplus or deficit are recognised in the income statement, including the current service cost, any past service cost and the effect of any settlements. The interest cost less the expected interest income on assets is also charged to the income statement. The amount charged to the income statement in respect of these plans is included within operating costs or in the Group’s share of the results of equity accounted operations, as appropriate.\n\nThe Group’s contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the income statement as they fall due.\n\nBackground At 31 March 2019 the Group operated a number of pension plans for the benefit of its employees throughout the world, with varying rights and obligations depending on the conditions and practices in the countries concerned. The Group’s pension plans are provided through both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements. Defined benefit schemes provide benefits based on the employees’ length of pensionable service and their final pensionable salary or other criteria. Defined contribution schemes offer employees individual funds that are converted into benefits at the time of retirement.\n\nThe Group operates defined benefit schemes in Germany, Ghana, India, Ireland, Italy, the UK, the United States and the Group operates defined benefit indemnity plans in Greece and Turkey. Defined contribution pension schemes are currently provided in Egypt, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Portugal, South Africa, Spain and the UK.\n\nIncome statement expense\n\nDefined contribution schemes Defined benefit schemes Total amount charged to income statement (note 23)\n\n2019 €m 166 57 223\n\n2018 €m 178 44 222\n\n2017 €m 192 20 212\n\nDefined benefit schemes The Group’s retirement policy is to provide competitive pension provision, in each operating country, in line with the market median for that location. The Group’s preferred retirement provision is focused on Defined Contribution (‘DC’) arrangements and/or State provision for future service.\n\nThe Group’s main defined benefit funding liability is the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme (‘Vodafone UK plan’). Since June 2014 the plan has consisted of two segregated sections: the Vodafone Section and the Cable & Wireless Section (‘CWW Section’). Both sections are closed to new entrants and to future accrual. The Group also operates smaller funded and unfunded plans in the UK, funded and unfunded plans in Germany and funded plans in Ireland. Defined benefit pension provision exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as longer than expected longevity of participants, lower than expected return on investments and higher than expected inflation, which may increase the liabilities or reduce the value of assets of the schemes.\n\nThe main defined benefit schemes are administered by trustee boards which are legally separate from the Group and consist of representatives who are employees, former employees or are independent from the Company. The boards of the pension schemes are required by legislation to act in the best interest of the participants, set the investment strategy and contribution rates and are subject to statutory funding objectives.\n\nThe Vodafone UK plan is registered as an occupational pension plan with HM Revenue and Customs (‘HMRC’) and is subject to UK legislation and operates within the framework outlined by the Pensions Regulator. UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently and that valuations are undertaken at least every three years. Separate valuations are required for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section.\n\nThe trustees obtain regular actuarial valuations to check whether the statutory funding objective is met and whether a recovery plan is required to restore funding to the level of the agreed technical provisions. On 19 October 2017, the 31 March 2016 triennial actuarial valuation for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section of the Vodafone UK plan, which is used to judge the funding the Group needs to put into the scheme, was concluded.",

We deleveraged during the second half of 2019 and remain committed to a target leverage profile consistent with a mid to high single A credit rating within a couple of years.\n\nOn July 9, 2019, we closed the acquisition of Red Hat for cash consideration of $34.8 billion. The transaction was funded through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from debt issuances. In order to reduce this debt and return to target leverage ratios within a couple of years, we suspended our share repurchase program at the time of the Red Hat acquisition closing. In the second half of 2019, we reduced debt levels by $10.1 billion. Refer to note P, “Borrowings,” for additional details of financing this transaction.\n\nThe indenture governing our debt securities and our various credit facilities each contain significant covenants which obligate the company to promptly pay principal and interest, limit the aggregate amount of secured indebtedness and sale and leaseback transactions to 10 percent of IBM’s consolidated net tangible assets, and restrict our ability to merge or consolidate unless certain conditions are met. The credit facilities also include a covenant on our consolidated net interest expense ratio, which cannot be less than 2.20 to 1.0, as well as a cross default provision with respect to other defaulted indebtedness of at least $500 million.\n\nWe are in compliance with all of our significant debt covenants and provide periodic certification to our lenders. The failure to comply with debt covenants could constitute an event of default with respect to our debt to which such provisions apply. If certain events of default were to occur, the principal and interest on the debt to which such event of default applied would become immediately due and payable.\n\nWe do not have “ratings trigger” provisions in our debt covenants or documentation, which would allow the holders to declare an event of default and seek to accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating. Our contractual agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the agreement if IBM’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade. At December 31, 2019, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was $673 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of the company’s outstanding instruments and market conditions. We have no other contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would result in a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity.\n\nIn July 2017, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. Various central bank committees and working groups continue to discuss replacement of benchmark rates, the process for amending existing LIBOR-based contracts, and the potential economic impacts of different alternatives. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred alternative rate for USD LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. We are evaluating the potential impact of the replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, including risk management, internal operational readiness and monitoring the FASB standard-setting process to address financial reporting issues that might arise in connection with transition from LIBOR to a new benchmark rate.\n\nWe prepare our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with applicable accounting standards for cash flow presentation on page 71 and highlight causes and events underlying sources and uses of cash in that format on page 45. For the purpose of running its business, IBM manages, monitors and analyzes cash flows in a different format.\n\nManagement uses free cash flow as a measure to evaluate its operating results, plan share repurchase levels, strategic investments and assess its ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. We define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and net cash from operating activities that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables. Free cash flow guidance is derived using an estimate of profit, working capital and operational cash flows. Since we view Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment which we seek to maximize, it is not considered when formulating guidance for free cash flow. As a result, we do not estimate a GAAP Net Cash from Operations expectation metric."

During 2019, we also sold the first 12 teams for the Call of Duty League, which began its first season in January 2020.\n\nInternational Sales\n\nInternational sales are a fundamental part of our business. An important element of our international strategy is to develop\n\ncontent that is specifically directed toward local cultures and customs. Net revenues from international sales accounted for approximately 54%, 54%, and 55% of our total consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The majority of our net revenues from foreign countries are generated by consumers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business, including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changes in local economies. Accordingly, our future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in local economies.\n\nOperating Metrics\n\nThe following operating metrics are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business. The key drivers of\n\nchanges in our operating metrics are presented in the order of significance.\n\nNet bookings and In-game net bookings\n\nWe monitor net bookings as a key operating metric in evaluating the performance of our business because it enables an analysis of performance based on the timing of actual transactions with our customers and provides more timely indication of trends in our operating results. Net bookings is the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period, and includes license fees, merchandise, and publisher incentives, among others. Net bookings is equal to net revenues excluding the impact from deferrals. In-game net bookings primarily includes the net amount of downloadable content and microtransactions sold during the period, and is equal to in-game net revenues excluding the impact from deferrals.\n\nNet bookings and in-game net bookings were as follows (amounts in millions):\n\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nIncrease (Decrease)\n\nNet bookings\n\n$\n\n6,388\n\n$\n\n7,262\n\n$\n\nIn-game net bookings\n\n$\n\n3,366\n\n$\n\n4,203\n\n$\n\nNet bookings\n\nThe decrease in net bookings for 2019, as compared to 2018, was primarily due to:\n\n\n\na $572 million decrease in Blizzard net bookings primarily driven by (1) lower net bookings from Hearthstone and (2) overall lower net bookings from World of Warcraft expansion and in-game content sales, primarily due to World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth, which was released in August 2018, with no comparable release in 2019 (although net bookings from subscriptions increased due to the release of World of Warcraft Classic in August 2019);\n\n\n\na $239 million decrease in Activision net bookings primarily driven by (1) lower net bookings from the Destiny franchise (reflecting our sale of the publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie in December 2018) and (2) lower net bookings from Call of Duty franchise catalog titles, partially offset by net bookings from Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled, and Call of Duty: Mobile, which were new releases in March 2019, June 2019, and October 2019, respectively; and\n\n33\n\n33\n\n"

The objectives of the PSU Plan are to retain executive officers and designated employees, to align their interests with those of the shareholders and to sustain positive corporate performance, as measured by an economic value creation formula, a performance measure used by management. The number of PSUs is based on the dollar value of the award and the average closing stock price of the Corporation for the previous twelve month period ending August 31. The PSUs vest over a three-year less one day period, based on the level of increase in the economic value of the Corporation or the relevant subsidiary for the preceding three-year period ending August 31, meaning that no vesting will occur if there is no increase in the economic value. The participants are entitled to receive dividend equivalents in the form of additional PSUs but only with respect to vested PSUs. PSUs are redeemable in case of death, permanent disability, normal retirement or termination of employment not for cause, in which cases, the holder of PSUs is entitled to payment of the PSUs in proportion to the time of employment from the date of the grant to the date of termination versus the three-year less one day vesting period. A trust was created for the purpose of purchasing these shares on the stock market in order to protect against stock price fluctuation and the Corporation instructed the trustee to purchase subordinate voting shares of the Corporation on the stock market. These shares are purchased and are held in trust for the participants until they are fully vested. The trust, considered as a special purpose entity, is consolidated in the Corporation’s financial statements with the value of the acquired subordinate voting shares held in trust under the PSU Plan presented in reduction of share capital.\n\nUnder the PSU Plan, the following PSUs were granted by the Corporation and are outstanding at August 31:\n\nYears ended August 31,\n\n2019\n\nOutstanding, beginning of the year\n\n133,181\n\nGranted (1)\n\n45,800\n\nPerformance-based additional units granted\n\n200\n\nDistributed\n\n(43,319)\n\nCancelled\n\n(31,889)\n\nDividend equivalents\n\n3,578\n\nOutstanding, end of the year\n\n107,551\n\n(1)\n\nFor the year ended August 31, 2019, the Corporation granted 14,625 (19,025 in 2018) PSUs to Cogeco's executive officers as executive officers of the Corporation.\n\nA compensation expense of $1,400,000 ($2,198,000 in 2018) was recorded for the year ended August 31, 2019 related to this plan.\n\nDSU plan\n\nThe Corporation also offers a Deferred Share Unit (\"DSU\") Plan for members of the Board to assist in the attraction and retention of qualified individuals to serve on the Board of the Corporation. Each existing or new member of the Board may elect to be paid a percentage of the annual retainer in the form of DSUs with the balance, if any, being paid in cash. The number of DSUs that a member is entitled to receive is based on the average closing price of the subordinate shares on the TSX for the twenty consecutive trading days immediately preceding by one day the date of issue. Dividend equivalents are awarded with respect to DSUs in a member's account on the same basis as if the member was a shareholder of record of subordinate shares on the relevant record date, and the dividend equivalents are credited to the individual's account as additional DSUs. DSUs are redeemable and payable in cash or in shares, upon an individual ceasing to be a member of the Board or in the event of the death of the member.\n\nUnder the DSU Plan, the following DSUs were issued by the Corporation and are outstanding at August 31:\n\nYears ended August 31,\n\n2019\n\nOutstanding, beginning of the year\n\n42,607\n\nIssued\n\n11,328\n\nRedeemed\n\n(12,351)\n\nDividend equivalents\n\n1,095\n\nOutstanding, end of the year\n\n42,679\n\nA compensation expense of $1,792,000 (compensation expense reduction of $181,000 in 2018) was recorded for the year ended August 31, 2019 related to this plan.\n\n116 COGECO COMMUNICATIONS INC. 2019 ANNUAL REPORT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n2018\n\n101,538\n\n47,900\n\n(35,892)\n\n(8,071)\n\n105,475\n\n2018\n\n115,207\n\n65,525\n\n2,639\n\n(41,441)\n\n(12,184)\n\n3,435\n\n133,181\n\n2018\n\n40,446\n\n6,662\n\n(5,549)\n\n1,048\n\n"

The volatility is a measure of the amount by which the Company’s share price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate; the Company used its common stock volatility along with the average of historic volatilities of comparative companies. The dividend yield is zero as the Company has not made any dividend payment and has no plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. The Company determines the expected term of its stock option awards by using the simplified method, which assumes each vesting tranche of the award has a term equal to average of the contractual term and the vesting period.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, total compensation cost not yet recognized related to unvested stock options was approximately $0.8 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years.\n\nRESTRICTED STOCK UNITS\n\nThe following is a summary of RSUs award activity for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nNumber of Shares\n\nWeighted Average Grant Date Fair Value\n\nNumber of Shares\n\nWeighted Average Grant Date Fair Value\n\nNon-vested at beginning of year Shares granted Shares vested\n\n315,292 $ 253,113 82,270\n\n2.26 2.17 2.28\n\n438,712 $ 200,000 323,420\n\n2.28 3.16 2.84\n\nNon-vested at end of year\n\n486,135 $\n\n2.53\n\n315,292 $\n\n2.26\n\nThe Company estimates the fair value of the granted shares using the market price of the Company’s stock price at the grant date.

In conjunction with the changes to reporting units, we reassigned goodwill between CGD and CMS based on their relative fair values on October 1, 2017.\n\nIn July 2017, we acquired Deltenna, a wireless infrastructure company specializing in the design and delivery of radio and antenna communication solutions. Deltenna’s operations were included in our CGD reporting unit upon its acquisition. On April 1, 2019, we reorganized our reporting structure to include Deltenna in our CMS reporting unit and reassigned $3.4 million of goodwill from CGD to CMS based upon its relative fair value. Since its acquisition, Deltenna’s sales, operating results, and cash flows have not been significant to our consolidated results. As such, reportable segment information has not been restated for this change in the composition of our reportable segments.\n\nWe complete our annual goodwill impairment test each year as of July 1 separately for our CTS, CGD and CMS reporting units.\n\nThe test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process. The first step of the test is performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including recorded goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment, if any, by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount. Any resulting impairment determined would be recorded in the current period.\n\nFor our 2019 impairment test, the estimated fair value of all three of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts.

Sales increased by 5.0% (3.2% normalised) to $8.7 billion with comparable sales increasing 2.3%. The market remained subdued throughout the year with declining volumes offset by price and mix improvements. Sales growth in H2 improved on H1 in both Dan Murphy’s and BWS, with Endeavour Drinks’ sales increasing by 4.8% (normalised) with comparable sales increasing 4.0%, compared to 0.7% growth in H1. The timing of New Year’s Day boosted sales in H2 by 84 bps and Q3, in particular, also benefitted from more stable weather compared to Q2. Dan Murphy’s focus on ‘discovery’ driven range, service and convenience is also beginning to resonate with customers. BWS maintained its strong trading momentum, with enhancements to localised ranging and tailored Woolworths Rewards offerings. The BWS store network grew to 1,346 stores with 30 net new stores and the new BWS Renewal format successfully extended to key urban standalone stores. BWS’ convenience offering continued to expand, with On Demand delivery now available in 605 stores, supporting double‐digit online sales growth. Jimmy Brings expanded its geographical reach to Brisbane, Gold Coast, Canberra and new suburbs in Sydney and Melbourne. Dan Murphy’s delivered double‐digit Online sales growth with new customer offerings, including the roll out of On Demand delivery to 91 stores and 30‐minute\n\nPick up from all stores. In‐store customer experience was enhanced with the introduction of wine merchants in key stores, to improve team product knowledge and customer discovery, while memberships in My Dan’s loyalty program increased 15% on the prior year. Dan Murphy’s store network grew to 230 with three new store openings in Q4 including the first store to be powered by solar energy. Endeavour Drinks sales per square metre increased by 3.2% (1.4% normalised) with sales growth above net average space growth of 1.7%. Gross margin was 22.9%, 14 bps down on a normalised basis, with trading margin improvements offset by higher freight costs attributable to petrol prices, growth in online delivery and category mix. Normalised CODB as a percentage of sales grew 64 bps, driven by a $21 million impairment charge related to goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the Summergate business in China. Summergate has now transitioned to ExportCo. Excluding Summergate, normalised CODB as a percentage of sales increased by 40 bps due to above‐inflationary cost pressures, as well as targeted investment in key focus areas including customer experience, ranging, data and analytics. Endeavour Drinks EBIT for F19 decreased 8.2% to $474 million. EBIT normalised for the 53rd week and Summergate impairment of $21 million decreased 5.6%.

Dorrien Estate Winery,\n\nVinpac and Angaston production facility recently undertook an audit, resulting\n\nin a pleasing waste and recycling performance, diverting over 99% of waste\n\nfrom landfill. Since the audit, the facilities have switched from single-use to\n\nceramic cups, begun recycling corks and are looking at innovative ways to recycle\n\nproblematic waste, with the aim of closing the gap to achieve zero waste to landfill.\n\nEndeavour Drinks is also collaborating with APCO and industry leaders such as the\n\nWinemakers’ Federation of Australia to identify and address sustainable packaging\n\nissues affecting the industry. Several initiatives are underway, including:\n\nA pilot waste audit at 22 stores in South Australia to identify improvements and how packaging sustainability can be progressed at store level\n\n\n\nIdentifying opportunities to reduce the quantity of plastic stretch wrap used\n\nto distribute wine products across the supply chain and how to increase\n\nrecovery of this material\n\nDeveloping, with APCO and others, a set of guidelines for retailers, winemakers and their suppliers on sustainable packaging opportunities for wine, supported\n\nby awards that recognise good performance\n\nCollaborating with others in the industry to ‘lightweight’ wine stock bottles\n\nThe wine experts\n\nEndeavour Drinks\n\nOn Demand\n\nDuring the year, Dan Murphy’s deployed\n\n35 wine merchants across selected\n\nDan Murphy’s to help drive discovery\n\nOn Demand continued to gain\n\nand improve the in-store experience.\n\nmomentum across Endeavour\n\nEarly feedback has been encouraging\n\nDrinks in F19, expanding to\n\nfrom customers with requests to\n\n605 BWS and 91 Dan Murphy’s\n\nspeak with the wine merchant on\n\nstores across the network.\n\nreturn visits and more discovery\n\nUltra-convenient offer Jimmy\n\nof new products previously not\n\nBrings was also expanded during\n\nconsidered.

This has been primarily driven by our efficiency initiatives delivering strong energy reductions in North America and APAC. There was an increase in energy use in EMEA, driven by the opening of new sites in the UK and Finland, and an increase in energy use at our site in Paris. Gas use also increased in the year by 7 per cent, with all sites seeing similar increases over 2018.\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions Spirent is committed to acting to combat climate change and reporting its progress. Our total Scope 1 and 2 emissions dropped by 6.14 per cent from 2018, and our emissions per $ million of revenue were down by 10.9 per cent. We have reduced our total emissions by 29 per cent since our 2014 baseline.\n\nThe Group responded to the Carbon Disclosure Project in 2019, completing the Climate Change and Supply Chain questionnaires. In 2019 we achieved a Climate Change rating of B (management) (2018 C) and a Supplier Engagement rating of B (management) (2018 B). The average for our sector is C in both categories.\n\nMethodology Reporting on emission sources is required under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors Report) Regulations 2013 and these sources fall within our consolidated financial statements. We have reported on all the emission sources that fall within our consolidated financial statements. We do not have any responsibility for any emission sources that are not included in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe have used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition), along with data gathered to fulfil our requirements under these Regulations, and the most recent emission factors available: UK Government’s GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2019 for the UK, US EPA 2018 eGrid emissions factors for the applicable individual states in the US, and 2018 emissions factors for all other countries were sourced from the International Energy Agency’s 2019 data set.\n\nPerformance against target The Group set a target to reduce carbon emissions by five per cent relative to revenue from 2018 figures. We have achieved this target, having reduced carbon emissions per $million of revenue by 10.9 per cent.\n\nCompliance The Group is not required to comply with stages 1 or 2 of the UK Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (ESOS) Regulations 2014.\n\nProcurement Vendor assessment and auditing Vendors are required to abide by our Code of Conduct which sets out our expectations for environmental management, labour and human rights, health and safety, and business ethics.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued April 30, 2019 and 2018\n\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits, is as follows (in thousands):\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nBalance at the beginning of the fiscal year Additions based on positions taken in the current year Additions based on positions taken in prior years Decreases based on positions taken in prior years Lapse in statute of limitations Balance at the end of the fiscal year\n\n$\n\n$\n\n1,264 $ - 142 (119 ) (29 ) 1,258 $\n\n1,626 - - (304) (58) 1,264\n\nThe entire amount reflected in the table above at April 30, 2019, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate. As of April 30, 2019, and 2018, the Company had $64,000 and $10,000, respectively, accrued for the payment of interest and penalties. For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized interest and penalties of $54,000 and $3,000, respectively. Although it is difficult to predict or estimate the change in the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that decreases in unrecognized tax benefits of up to $40,000 may be recognized during the next twelve months.\n\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. federal, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to examination of its federal income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service for fiscal years 2016 and prior. During Fiscal 2018, the Company closed an Internal Revenue Service examination of its Fiscal 2016 tax return with no change to the tax liability reported. The Company is no longer subject to examination by the taxing authorities in its foreign jurisdictions for Fiscal 2015 and prior. Net operating losses and tax attributes generated by domestic and foreign entities in closed years and utilized in open years are subject to adjustment by the tax authorities.\n\n14. Segment Information\n\nThe Company operates under two reportable segments based on the geographic locations of its subsidiaries:\n\n(1)\n\nFEI-NY – operates out of New York and its operations consist principally of precision time and frequency control products used in three principal markets- communication satellites (both commercial and U.S. Government-funded); terrestrial cellular telephone or other ground-based telecommunication stations; and other components and systems for the U.S. military.\n\nThe FEI-NY segment also includes the operations of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, FEI-Elcom and FEI-Asia. FEI- Asia functions as a manufacturing facility for the FEI-NY segment with historically minimal sales to outside customers. FEI- Elcom, in addition to its own product line, provides design and technical support for the FEI-NY segment’s satellite business.\n\n(2)\n\nFEI-Zyfer – operates out of California and its products incorporate Global Positioning System (GPS) technologies into systems and subsystems for secure communications, both government and commercial, and other locator applications. This segment also provides sales and support for the Company’s wireline telecommunications family of products, including US5G, which are sold in the U. S. market.\n\nThe Company measures segment performance based on total revenues and profits generated by each geographic location rather than on the specific types of customers or end-users. Consequently, the Company determined that the segments indicated above most appropriately reflect the way the Company’s management views the business.\n\nThe accounting policies of the two segments are the same as those described in the “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” The Company evaluates the performance of its segments and allocates resources to them based on operating profit which is defined as income before investment income, interest expense and taxes. All acquired assets, including intangible assets, are included in the assets of both reporting segments.\n\n",

During fiscal 2019, we recognized a tax benefit of $48 million attributable to the effective settlement and the release of related tax reserves.\n\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was enacted into law. The TCJA made significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the imposition of a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign earnings, and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires companies to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment. However, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the TCJA enactment date.\n\nAs a result of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate change, effective as of January 1, 2018, we remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future periods. During fiscal 2018, we recorded $108 million of tax expense related to all tax rate changes. Upon finalization of our provisional estimates during the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we recorded tax expense of $6 million related to deferred tax assets for equity-based compensation awards to our executives.\n\nThe TCJA imposes a mandatory, one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and profits not previously subject to U.S.\n\nincome tax at a rate of 15.5% on earnings to the extent of foreign cash and other liquid assets, and 8% on the remaining earnings. In fiscal 2018, we recorded a $732 million discrete tax expense for the estimated U.S. federal and state income tax impacts of the transition tax. In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we finalized our computation of the transition tax and recorded a reduction of $5 million to our provisional estimate.\n\nAs of April 26, 2019, we have completed the accounting for the tax impacts of the TCJA, however, we will continue to assess the impact of further guidance from federal and state tax authorities on our business and consolidated financial statements, and recognize any adjustments in the period in which they are determined.\n\nUnder the TCJA, the global minimum tax on intangible income (GMT) provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a\n\ndeemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. Under U.S. GAAP, companies are allowed to make an accounting policy election to either (i) account for GMT as a component of tax expense in the period in which a company is subject to the rules, or (ii) account for GMT in a company’s measurement of deferred taxes. We have elected to recognize the GMT as a period cost and thus recorded $22 million of tax expense for federal and state impacts for fiscal 2019.\n\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued an ASU which eliminates the deferred tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers other than\n\ninventory. As a result, tax expense from the sale of an asset in the seller’s tax jurisdiction is recognized when the transfer occurs, even though the pre-tax effects of that transaction are eliminated in consolidation.\n\nDuring fiscal 2017, we adopted a new accounting standard that simplifies stock-based compensation income tax accounting and presentation within the financial statements and recorded a tax charge of $18 million following the post-adoption rules which require that all excess tax benefits and deficiencies from stock-based compensation be recognized as a component of income tax expense.\n\n80\n\nThe components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions):\n\nApril 26, 2019\n\nApril 27, 2018\n\nDeferred tax assets:\n\nReserves and accruals Net operating loss and credit carryforwards Stock-based compensation Deferred revenue Other\n\nGross deferred tax assets Valuation allowance\n\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance\n\n$\n\n50 $ 139 16 205 16 426 (123 ) 303\n\n57 131 22 156 29 395 (109 ) 286\n\nDeferred tax liabilities:\n\nPrepaids and accruals Acquired intangibles Property and equipment Other\n\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance and deferred tax liabilities\n\n$\n\n31 32 31 10 104 199 $\n\n21 29 25 14 89 197\n\nThe valuation allowance increased by $14 million in fiscal 2019. The increase is mainly attributable to corresponding changes in\n\ndeferred tax assets, primarily foreign tax credit carryforwards and certain state tax credit carryforwards.\n\nAs of April 26, 2019, we have federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $2 million and $3 million,\n\nrespectively. In addition, we have gross state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of $25 million and $138 million, respectively. The majority of the state credit carryforwards are California research credits which are offset by a valuation allowance as we believe it is more likely than not that these credits will not be utilized. We also have $4 million of foreign net operating losses, and $43 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards generated by our Dutch subsidiary which are fully offset by a valuation allowance. Certain acquired net operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382, but are expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance. The federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards and credits will expire in various years from fiscal 2020 through 2038. The California research credit and Dutch foreign tax credit carryforwards do not expire.\n\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):\n\nBalance at beginning of period\n\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year Additions for tax positions of prior years Decreases for tax positions of prior years Settlements\n\nBalance at end of period\n\nYear Ended April 27, 2018\n\n"

We deleveraged during the second half of 2019 and remain committed to a target leverage profile consistent with a mid to high single A credit rating within a couple of years.\n\nOn July 9, 2019, we closed the acquisition of Red Hat for cash consideration of $34.8 billion. The transaction was funded through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from debt issuances. In order to reduce this debt and return to target leverage ratios within a couple of years, we suspended our share repurchase program at the time of the Red Hat acquisition closing. In the second half of 2019, we reduced debt levels by $10.1 billion. Refer to note P, “Borrowings,” for additional details of financing this transaction.\n\nThe indenture governing our debt securities and our various credit facilities each contain significant covenants which obligate the company to promptly pay principal and interest, limit the aggregate amount of secured indebtedness and sale and leaseback transactions to 10 percent of IBM’s consolidated net tangible assets, and restrict our ability to merge or consolidate unless certain conditions are met. The credit facilities also include a covenant on our consolidated net interest expense ratio, which cannot be less than 2.20 to 1.0, as well as a cross default provision with respect to other defaulted indebtedness of at least $500 million.\n\nWe are in compliance with all of our significant debt covenants and provide periodic certification to our lenders. The failure to comply with debt covenants could constitute an event of default with respect to our debt to which such provisions apply. If certain events of default were to occur, the principal and interest on the debt to which such event of default applied would become immediately due and payable.\n\nWe do not have “ratings trigger” provisions in our debt covenants or documentation, which would allow the holders to declare an event of default and seek to accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating. Our contractual agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the agreement if IBM’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade. At December 31, 2019, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was $673 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of the company’s outstanding instruments and market conditions. We have no other contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would result in a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity.\n\nIn July 2017, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. Various central bank committees and working groups continue to discuss replacement of benchmark rates, the process for amending existing LIBOR-based contracts, and the potential economic impacts of different alternatives. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred alternative rate for USD LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. We are evaluating the potential impact of the replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, including risk management, internal operational readiness and monitoring the FASB standard-setting process to address financial reporting issues that might arise in connection with transition from LIBOR to a new benchmark rate.\n\nWe prepare our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with applicable accounting standards for cash flow presentation on page 71 and highlight causes and events underlying sources and uses of cash in that format on page 45. For the purpose of running its business, IBM manages, monitors and analyzes cash flows in a different format.\n\nManagement uses free cash flow as a measure to evaluate its operating results, plan share repurchase levels, strategic investments and assess its ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. We define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and net cash from operating activities that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables. Free cash flow guidance is derived using an estimate of profit, working capital and operational cash flows. Since we view Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment which we seek to maximize, it is not considered when formulating guidance for free cash flow. As a result, we do not estimate a GAAP Net Cash from Operations expectation metric.",

We brought additional new innovations to the market in 2019 including: the financial services public cloud, z15 and high-end storage and we have a leadership position in quantum computing. With these innovations, we built momentum for growth in 2020.\n\nAt the time of our fourth-quarter earnings report, analysts’ estimates of our revenue growth were approximately 3 percent for 2020, which we stated was reasonable. This includes about a 1 point impact from businesses divested in 2019, and January 17, 2020 expectations for currency translation. This also includes an expectation of an improving trend in GTS, predominantly in the second half of 2020. We also expect to expand GAAP and operating (non-GAAP) gross margins and pre-tax income will include impacts from significant structural actions in 2020, primarily in our GTS business as we shift toward a more asset-based model to create a more competitive, flexible structure.\n\nFor full-year 2020, we expect the GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 3 to 6 percent, including an estimate for potential discrete tax events (discretes). We expect the operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for 2020 to be approximately 7 to 9 percent, including an estimate of potential discretes. We expect a discrete tax benefit in the first quarter of 2020. Together with the expected structural actions described above, we anticipate that these two items will be approximately neutral to the first- quarter and full-year 2020 earnings per share. Discretes by their nature are difficult to estimate and the actual impacts will be recorded as the discrete events occur. The rates will change year to year based on discrete tax events, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors including the geographic mix of income before taxes, state and local taxes and the effects of various global income tax strategies. The GAAP effective tax rate could also be affected by adjustments to the previously recorded charges for U.S. tax reform attributable to any changes in law, new regulations and guidance, audit adjustments, among others.\n\nAt constant currency, we expect accelerated growth of about 0.5 points from the fourth-quarter 2019 revenue growth rates to first-quarter 2020. At January 17, 2020 spot rates, we expect currency to be a headwind to first-quarter revenue growth of about 1.0 to 1.5 points, as compared to a headwind of 0.6 points in the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\nConsistent with the acquisition of a highly profitable software business, non-cash purchase accounting adjustments resulted in the Red Hat acquisition being dilutive to full-year 2019 earnings per share. In an acquisition, U.S. GAAP requires a company to record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair value. This includes the acquired deferred revenue balance. This resulted in a non-cash adjustment of $2.2 billion to the acquired deferred revenue balance and resulted in a reduction to reported revenue post-closing. The level of adjustment reflects the high margin profile of Red Hat’s subscription-based business. While there will be continued impact in 2020 from the deferred revenue adjustment from the Red Hat purchase accounting, it will largely be in the first half and lessen throughout the year.\n\nOverall, we expect GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations for 2020 to be at least $10.57. Excluding acquisition-related charges of $1.70 per share, non-operating retirement-related items of $1.02 per share and tax reform enactment impacts of $0.06 per share, operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share is expected to be at least $13.35. For the first quarter of 2020, we expect GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations to be 12 to 13 percent of the full-year expectation and operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share to be approximately 14 to 15 percent of the respective full-year expectation. This reflects typical seasonality of IBM’s operations, and the impact of the Red Hat deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustment.\n\nWe expect free cash flow to be approximately $12.5 billion in 2020. This includes contribution from Red Hat combined with incremental software and services synergy profits and net of incremental interest to finance the transaction and other acquisition-related charges. Free cash flow expectations reflect expected operational profit performance, partially offset by headwinds in capital expenditures and cash tax.\n\nThe Red Hat acquisition was funded through a combination of cash and debt, with the incremental debt issued in the first half of 2019. We will continue with a disciplined financial policy and are committed to maintaining strong investment-grade credit ratings. Since the end of the second quarter of 2019, we reduced our debt balance by $10.1 billion. We are continuing to target a leverage profile consistent with a mid to high single A credit rating within a couple years, while maintaining our solid and growing dividend. We suspended our share repurchase program at the close of the acquisition to direct our free cash flow towards reducing debt levels. The combination of these actions provides us with the flexibility to invest in the business going forward.\n\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2019 and continuing throughout the year, IBM’s Global Financing business wound down the portion of its commercial financing operations which provides short-term working capital solutions for OEM information technology suppliers, distributors and resellers. This was consistent with our capital allocation strategy and high-value focus. IBM Global Financing will continue to provide differentiated end-to-end financing solutions, including commercial financing in support of IBM partner relationships.\n\nWe expect 2020 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $2.7 billion, an increase of approximately $600 million compared to 2019. This estimate reflects current pension plan assumptions at December 31, 2019. Within total retirement-related plan cost, operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion, approximately flat versus 2019. Non-operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.2 billion, an increase of approximately $600 million compared to 2019, primarily driven by lower income from expected return on assets. Contributions for all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.3 billion in 2020, an increase of approximately $100 million compared to 2019.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources The company has consistently generated strong cash flow from operations, providing a source of funds ranging between $14.8 billion and $16.7 billion per year over the past three years. The company provides for additional liquidity through several sources: maintaining an adequate cash balance, access to\n\n57\n\n58\n\nglobal funding sources, committed global credit facilities and other committed and uncommitted lines of credit worldwide.

The majority of our shell eggs are sold at independently quoted wholesale market prices for shell eggs or formulas related to our costs of production which include the cost of corn and soybean meal. The following table shows our net income (loss), gross profit, net average shell egg selling price, the average Urner Barry wholesale large shell egg prices in the southeast region, and feed cost per dozen produced for each of our three most recent fiscal years.\n\nFiscal Year ended\n\nJune 1, 2019\n\nJune 2, 2018\n\nJune 3, 2017\n\nNet income (loss) attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. - (in thousands) Gross profit (in thousands) Net average shell egg selling price (rounded) Average Urner Barry Spot Egg Market Quotations 1 Feed cost per dozen produced\n\n$\n\n54,229 $ 222,859 1.27 1.23 0.415\n\n125,932 $ 361,046 1.40 1.49 0.394\n\n(74,278) 45,550 1.01 0.85 0.399\n\n1- Average Thursday price for the large market (i.e. generic shell eggs) in the southeastern region\n\nThe shell egg industry has historically been subject to periods of high profitability followed by periods of significant loss. The periods of high profitability have often reflected increased consumer demand relative to supply while the periods of significant loss have often reflected excess supply for the then prevailing consumer demand. Historically, demand for shell eggs increases in line with overall population growth. As reflected above, our operating results fluctuate with changes in the spot egg market quote and feed costs. The net average shell egg selling price is the blended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs, including non-graded shell egg sales, breaking stock and undergrades. In fiscal 2017, our net average selling price and dozens sold decreased over the previous fiscal year primarily due to the oversupply of eggs resulting from the repopulation of the national flock of laying hens to levels exceeding the flock size prior to the avian influenza outbreak in 2015, along with a reduced demand for egg products. In fiscal 2018, strong demand resulted in an increase in our average selling price and dozens sold, and feed costs decreased over prior years. Fiscal 2019 saw an increasing U.S. flock size result in oversupply of eggs, particularly in the last half of the fiscal year. This resulted in decreased gross profit and net income for fiscal 2019.\n\n24\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFiscal Year Ended June 1, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 2, 2018\n\nNET SALES\n\nNet sales for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019 were $1,361.2 million, a decrease of $141.7 million, or 9.4%, from net sales of $1,502.9 million for fiscal 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower selling prices for non-specialty eggs in fiscal 2019 due to the oversupply of eggs, particularly in the last half of the fiscal year, contrasted with fiscal 2018 in which we experienced strong demand resulting in higher prices for non-specialty eggs.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, shell egg sales made up approximately 97% of our net sales. Total dozens sold in fiscal 2019 were 1,038.9 million, an increase of 1.2 million dozen, or 0.1%, compared to 1,037.7 million sold in fiscal 2018 resulting in an increase in net sales of $1.7 million for fiscal 2019 compared with the prior year.\n\nNet average selling price of shell eggs decreased from $1.397 per dozen for fiscal 2018 to $1.265 per dozen for fiscal 2019, a decrease of $0.132 per dozen, or 9.4%, primarily reflecting an abundance of eggs in the market. The decrease in sales price in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2018 resulted in a corresponding decrease in net sales of approximately $137.1 million. Our operating results are significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices, which are outside of our control. Small changes in production or demand levels can have a large effect on shell egg prices.\n\nEgg products accounted for approximately 3% of our net sales. These revenues were $41.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019 compared with $43.5 million for the fiscal 2018.\n\nThe table below represents an analysis of our non-specialty and specialty, as well as co-pack specialty, shell egg sales.

An important element of our international strategy is to develop\n\ncontent that is specifically directed toward local cultures and customs. Net revenues from international sales accounted for approximately 54%, 54%, and 55% of our total consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The majority of our net revenues from foreign countries are generated by consumers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business, including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changes in local economies.

The key drivers of\n\nchanges in our operating metrics are presented in the order of significance.\n\nNet bookings and In-game net bookings\n\nWe monitor net bookings as a key operating metric in evaluating the performance of our business because it enables an analysis of performance based on the timing of actual transactions with our customers and provides more timely indication of trends in our operating results. Net bookings is the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period, and includes license fees, merchandise, and publisher incentives, among others.

The timing of New Year’s Day boosted sales in H2 by 84 bps and Q3, in particular, also benefitted from more stable weather compared to Q2. Dan Murphy’s focus on ‘discovery’ driven range, service and convenience is also beginning to resonate with customers. BWS maintained its strong trading momentum, with enhancements to localised ranging and tailored Woolworths Rewards offerings. The BWS store network grew to 1,346 stores with 30 net new stores and the new BWS Renewal format successfully extended to key urban standalone stores.

Dan Murphy’s store network grew to 230 with three new store openings in Q4 including the first store to be powered by solar energy. Endeavour Drinks sales per square metre increased by 3.2% (1.4% normalised) with sales growth above net average space growth of 1.7%. Gross margin was 22.9%, 14 bps down on a normalised basis, with trading margin improvements offset by higher freight costs attributable to petrol prices, growth in online delivery and category mix. Normalised CODB as a percentage of sales grew 64 bps, driven by a $21 million impairment charge related to goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the Summergate business in China. Summergate has now transitioned to ExportCo. Excluding Summergate, normalised CODB as a percentage of sales increased by 40 bps due to above‐inflationary cost pressures, as well as targeted investment in key focus areas including customer experience, ranging, data and analytics. Endeavour Drinks EBIT for F19 decreased 8.2% to $474 million. EBIT normalised for the 53rd week and Summergate impairment of $21 million decreased 5.6%.

Dorrien Estate Winery,\n\nVinpac and Angaston production facility recently undertook an audit, resulting\n\nin a pleasing waste and recycling performance, diverting over 99% of waste\n\nfrom landfill. Since the audit, the facilities have switched from single-use to\n\nceramic cups, begun recycling corks and are looking at innovative ways to recycle\n\nproblematic waste, with the aim of closing the gap to achieve zero waste to landfill.\n\nEndeavour Drinks is also collaborating with APCO and industry leaders such as the\n\nWinemakers’ Federation of Australia to identify and address sustainable packaging\n\nissues affecting the industry. Several initiatives are underway, including:\n\nA pilot waste audit at 22 stores in South Australia to identify improvements and how packaging sustainability can be progressed at store level\n\n\n\nIdentifying opportunities to reduce the quantity of plastic stretch wrap used\n\nto distribute wine products across the supply chain and how to increase\n\nrecovery of this material\n\nDeveloping, with APCO and others, a set of guidelines for retailers, winemakers and their suppliers on sustainable packaging opportunities for wine, supported\n\nby awards that recognise good performance\n\nCollaborating with others in the industry to ‘lightweight’ wine stock bottles\n\nThe wine experts\n\nEndeavour Drinks\n\nOn Demand\n\nDuring the year, Dan Murphy’s deployed\n\n35 wine merchants across selected\n\nDan Murphy’s to help drive discovery\n\nOn Demand continued to gain\n\nand improve the in-store experience.\n\nmomentum across Endeavour\n\nEarly feedback has been encouraging\n\nDrinks in F19, expanding to\n\nfrom customers with requests to\n\n605 BWS and 91 Dan Murphy’s\n\nspeak with the wine merchant on\n\nstores across the network.\n\nreturn visits and more discovery\n\nUltra-convenient offer Jimmy\n\nof new products previously not\n\nBrings was also expanded during\n\nconsidered.

            "performed in early 2019, the results of which were reported to the Audit Committee in March 2019. The key finding from the review was the need to increase the use of data analytics within the function.\n\nExternal auditor Transition of external auditor Deloitte was appointed as intu’s external auditor for the 2019 audit following approval at the 2019 AGM, succeeding PwC. Although it is still early into Deloitte’s tenure as intu’s external auditor, I am pleased that the transition of the external audit process has gone well. The Audit Committee has recommended that Deloitte be reappointed as external auditor at the 2020 AGM.\n\nA key area of focus for the Audit Committee in 2019 was the effective transition of the external audit process from PwC to Deloitte. For this to be achieved, a detailed transition plan was put in place between management and Deloitte with the aim of familiarising Deloitte with intu. In addition to regular communication between the Group finance team and Deloitte, the key areas of the transition plan included:\n\n— site visits to shopping centres to see how the assets are operated as well as meeting with centre management and leasing teams\n\n— meetings with the Group’s third- party valuers to understand the valuation process\n\n— detailed reviews of the Group’s\n\ncash flow, financing and covenant projections\n\nExternal auditor effectiveness The Audit Committee has assessed the effectiveness of the external auditor, Deloitte, in line with the approach set out in the FRC’s Audit Quality Practice Aid tailored to the fact that it is Deloitte’s first year as intu’s external auditor. In carrying out the evaluation for 2019 the Audit Committee has reviewed and challenged with the external auditor:\n\n— the 2019 audit plan presented by\n\nDeloitte, including the risks identified and its audit approach\n\n— the FRC’s audit quality inspection\n\nreview of Deloitte\n\n— the output of the audit, including reports to the Audit Committee and management\n\n— performance of the audit team\n\nNon-audit services On 1 January 2017 the Group implemented the FRC’s Ethical Standard for Auditors which imposes restrictions on certain non-audit services. The FRC’s Revised Ethical Standard will become effective for the Group from 15 March 2020. The majority of non-audit related services are prohibited and others require approval by the Audit Committee. There is a statutory overall fee limit of 70 per cent of the average of audit fees charged in the past three years.\n\nThe Audit Committee has sole authority to approve contracts for non-audit services with the external auditor, subject to observing certain guidelines. In order to ensure that external auditor independence and objectivity is maintained, the Audit Committee considers whether the proposed arrangements will maintain external auditor independence. The external auditor must also satisfy the Company that it is acting independently.\n\nThe table below summarises the fees paid to the external auditor over the last three years (with 2019 being attributable to Deloitte, and 2018 and 2017 attributable to PwC).\n\n— Deloitte shadowing PwC through the 2018 audit and attending the November 2018 and February 2019 Audit Committee meetings\n\n— regular communication between\n\nmanagement, Deloitte and PwC to agree and facilitate the handover process\n\n— Deloitte’s review of PwC’s 2018\n\naudit files\n\n— meetings with senior management across intu to familiarise Deloitte with key business processes\n\nat meetings\n\nThe above was assessed through internal feedback, direct meetings, reviews of internal as well as independent reports.\n\nFollowing this review, the Audit Committee has concluded that Deloitte has been effective in its role as external auditor for the 2019 audit. The Audit Committee will continue to review the effectiveness and independence of the external auditor each year.\n\nAudit Committee effectiveness As part of the Board evaluation process, the effectiveness of the Audit Committee was reviewed and this confirmed that the Committee remained effective at meeting its objectives.\n\nSteve Barber Chairman of the Audit Committee 12 March 2020\n\n2019 £000\n\n2018 £000\n\n2017 £000\n\nAudit fees Non-audit fees Total fees paid to auditor Ratio of non-audit fees to audit fees\n\n1,092 598 1,690 55%\n\n823 281 1,104 34%\n\n789 49 838 6%\n\nintu properties plc Annual report 2019\n\n",

During 2019, we also sold the first 12 teams for the Call of Duty League, which began its first season in January 2020.\n\nInternational Sales\n\nInternational sales are a fundamental part of our business. An important element of our international strategy is to develop\n\ncontent that is specifically directed toward local cultures and customs. Net revenues from international sales accounted for approximately 54%, 54%, and 55% of our total consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The majority of our net revenues from foreign countries are generated by consumers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business, including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changes in local economies. Accordingly, our future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in local economies.\n\nOperating Metrics\n\nThe following operating metrics are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business. The key drivers of\n\nchanges in our operating metrics are presented in the order of significance.\n\nNet bookings and In-game net bookings\n\nWe monitor net bookings as a key operating metric in evaluating the performance of our business because it enables an analysis of performance based on the timing of actual transactions with our customers and provides more timely indication of trends in our operating results. Net bookings is the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period, and includes license fees, merchandise, and publisher incentives, among others. Net bookings is equal to net revenues excluding the impact from deferrals. In-game net bookings primarily includes the net amount of downloadable content and microtransactions sold during the period, and is equal to in-game net revenues excluding the impact from deferrals.\n\nNet bookings and in-game net bookings were as follows (amounts in millions):\n\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nIncrease (Decrease)\n\nNet bookings\n\n$\n\n6,388\n\n$\n\n7,262\n\n$\n\nIn-game net bookings\n\n$\n\n3,366\n\n$\n\n4,203\n\n$\n\nNet bookings\n\nThe decrease in net bookings for 2019, as compared to 2018, was primarily due to:\n\n\n\na $572 million decrease in Blizzard net bookings primarily driven by (1) lower net bookings from Hearthstone and (2) overall lower net bookings from World of Warcraft expansion and in-game content sales, primarily due to World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth, which was released in August 2018, with no comparable release in 2019 (although net bookings from subscriptions increased due to the release of World of Warcraft Classic in August 2019);\n\n\n\na $239 million decrease in Activision net bookings primarily driven by (1) lower net bookings from the Destiny franchise (reflecting our sale of the publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie in December 2018) and (2) lower net bookings from Call of Duty franchise catalog titles, partially offset by net bookings from Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled, and Call of Duty: Mobile, which were new releases in March 2019, June 2019, and October 2019, respectively; and\n\n33\n\n33\n\n",

BWS maintained its strong trading momentum, with enhancements to localised ranging and tailored Woolworths Rewards offerings. The BWS store network grew to 1,346 stores with 30 net new stores and the new BWS Renewal format successfully extended to key urban standalone stores.

The cases were consolidated into In re: Processed Egg Products Antitrust Litigation, No. 2:08-md-02002-GP, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the “District Court”), in three groups of cases - the “Direct Purchaser Putative Class Action”, the “Indirect Purchaser Putative Class Action” and the “Non-Class Cases.”\n\nThe Direct Purchaser Putative Class Action. The named plaintiffs in these cases alleged that they purchased eggs or egg products directly from a defendant and sued on behalf of themselves and a putative class of others who claimed to be similarly situated. As previously reported, in November 2014, the District Court approved the Company’s settlement with the direct purchaser plaintiff class and entered final judgment dismissing with prejudice the class members’ claims against the Company.\n\nThe Indirect Purchaser Putative Class Action. The named plaintiffs in these cases are individuals or companies who allege that they purchased shell eggs indirectly from one or more of the defendants - that is, they purchased from retailers that had previously purchased from defendants or other parties - and sued on behalf of themselves and a putative class of others who claim to be similarly situated. The District Court denied the indirect purchaser plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. On June 28, 2018, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the indirect purchaser plaintiffs, for an immaterial amount, and on July 17, 2018, the Court entered an order dismissing all indirect purchaser plaintiffs’ claims against the Company and other defendants.\n\nThe Non-Class Cases. In the remaining cases, the named plaintiffs allege that they purchased shell eggs and egg products directly from one or more of the defendants but sue only for their own alleged damages and not on behalf of a putative class. On April 4, 2018, the Court entered a final judgement dismissing all claims against the Company brought by the following non-class plaintiffs: The Kroger Co.; Publix Super Markets, Inc.; SUPERVALU, Inc.; Safeway, Inc.; Albertsons LLC; H.E. Butt Grocery Co.; The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, Inc.; Walgreen Co.; Hy- Vee, Inc.; and Giant Eagle, Inc., with prejudice, pursuant to the Company’s previously announced $80.8 million settlement with the named plaintiffs.\n\nThe Company settled all Non-Class cases except for the claims of certain plaintiffs who sought substantial damages allegedly arising from the purchase of egg products (as opposed to shell eggs). As previously reported, the Company settled all claims brought by one of these plaintiffs, Conopco, Inc. on a confidential basis and for an amount that did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or results, and on November 21, 2018, the Court entered a final judgment dismissing Conopco’s claims against the Company.

ADTRAN, Inc. et al., Docket No. 19-cv-09619, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company, two of its current executive officers and one of its former executive officers. The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages on behalf of purported purchasers of ADTRAN securities between February 28, 2019 and October 9, 2019. The lawsuit claims that the defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding, and/or failed to disclose material adverse facts about, the Company’s business, operations and prospects, specifically relating to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, excess and obsolete inventory reserves, financial results and shipments to a Latin American customer. Investors in ADTRAN securities had until December 16, 2019 to move the court to serve as lead plaintiff in this action.\n\nOn December 16, 2019, two purported investors in ADTRAN securities filed motions seeking to be appointed lead plaintiff in the case. On January 6, 2020, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted Defendants’ unopposed request to transfer the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, where the case is now pending as Burbridge v. ADTRAN, Inc. et al., Docket No. 5:20-cv-00050-LCB. On January 27, 2020, the two prospective lead plaintiff movants filed a stipulation among plaintiffs seeking to be appointed as co-lead plaintiffs in the case.\n\nWe disagree with the claims made in the complaint and intend to vigorously defend against this lawsuit. At this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of or estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit.\n\n"

            "Risks associated with the scheme The Scheme exposes the Company to some risks, the most significant of which are:\n\nAsset volatility\n\nThe liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields. If assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The Scheme holds a significant proportion of growth assets (equities, diversified growth fund and global absolute return fund) which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term. The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Scheme’s long-term objectives.\n\nInflation risk\n\nA proportion of the Scheme’s benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation leads to higher liabilities (although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation). The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.\n\nChange in bond yields\n\nA decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the Scheme’s liabilities for accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Scheme’s bond holdings.\n\nLife expectancy\n\nThe majority of the Scheme’s obligations are to provide benefits for the lifetime of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.\n\nFunding requirements UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently. The ongoing funding valuation of the Scheme was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 30 April 2018 and showed a deficit of £0.2m. The Company paid deficit contributions of £70,000 for the year ending 31 March 2019 (2018: £70,000), and has committed to contribute £140,000 per annum from 1 April 2019, which is expected to make good this shortfall by 31 March 2020. The next funding valuation is due no later than 30 April 2021, at which progress towards full-funding will be reviewed. The Company also pays expenses and PPF levies incurred by the Scheme.\n\nAssumptions used The last triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme was performed by an independent professional actuary at 30 April 2018 using the projected unit method of valuation. For the purposes of IAS 19 (revised) the actuarial valuation as at 30 April 2018 has been updated on an approximate basis to 31 March 2019. There have been no changes in the valuation methodology adopted for this year’s disclosures compared to the prior year’s disclosures.\n\nThe principal financial assumptions used to calculate the liabilities under IAS 19 (revised) are as follows:\n\n2019 %\n\n2018 %\n\nDiscount rate for scheme liabilities\n\n2.45\n\n2.60\n\nCPI inflation\n\n2.35\n\n2.25\n\nRPI inflation\n\n3.45\n\n3.35\n\nPension increases\n\nPre 1988 GMP\n\n–\n\n–\n\nPost 1988 GMP\n\n2.10\n\n2.10\n\nPre 2004 non GMP\n\n5.00\n\n5.00\n\nPost 2004\n\n3.35\n\n3.25\n\nThe financial assumptions reflect the nature and term of the Scheme’s liabilities.\n\nThe Group has assumed that mortality will be in line with nationally published mortality table S2NA with CMI 2018 projections related to members’ years of birth with long-term rate of improvement of 1.5% per annum. These tables translate into an average life expectancy for a pensioner retiring at age 65 as follows:\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nMen Years\n\nWomen Years\n\nMen Years\n\nWomen Years\n\nMember aged 65 (current life expectancy)\n\n86.8\n\n88.9\n\n87.3\n\n89.3\n\nMember aged 45 (life expectancy at age 65)\n\n88.5\n\n90.7\n\n89.0\n\n91.1\n\nIt is assumed that 50% of non-retired members of the Scheme will commute the maximum amount of cash at retirement (2018: 50% of non-retired members of the Scheme will commute the maximum amount of cash at retirement).\n\n",
            "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued\n\n2 Alternative performance measures continued Net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) To assess the size of the net debt balance relative to the size of the earnings for the Group, we analyse net debt as a proportion of EBITDA. EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortisation of owned property, plant and equipment, software and development to adjusted operating profit. Net debt excludes IFRS 16 lease liabilities. The net debt to EBITDA ratio is calculated as follows:\n\n2019 £m\n\n2018 £m\n\nAdjusted operating profit Depreciation and amortisation of property, plant and equipment, software and development Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation Net debt Net debt to EBITDA\n\n282.7 34.3 317.0 295.2 0.9\n\n264.9 32.9 297.8 235.8 0.8\n\nThe components of net debt are disclosed in Note 24.\n\nOrganic measures As we are a multi-national group of companies, which trade in a large number of foreign currencies and regularly acquire and sometimes dispose of companies, we also refer to organic performance measures throughout the Annual Report. These strip out the effects of the movement of foreign currency exchange rates and of acquisitions and disposals. The Board believes that this allows users of the accounts to gain a further understanding of how the Group has performed.\n\nExchange translation movements are assessed by re-translating prior period reported values to current period exchange rates. Exchange transaction impacts on operating profit are assessed on the basis of transactions being at constant currency between years.\n\nAny acquisitions and disposals that occurred in either the current period or prior period are excluded from the results of both the prior and current period at current period exchange rates.\n\nThe organic percentage movement is calculated as the organic movement divided by the sum of the prior period and exchange.\n\nThe organic bps change in adjusted operating margin is the difference between the current period margin excluding acquisitions and disposals and the prior period margin at current period exchange rates excluding acquisitions and disposals.\n\nA reconciliation of the movement in revenue and adjusted operating profit compared to the prior period is given below.\n\nRevenue Adjusted operating profit Adjusted operating margin\n\n2018 £1,153.3m £264.9m 23.0%\n\nExchange – (£2.0m)\n\nOrganic £73.9m £18.2m\n\nAcquisitions and disposals\n\n2019 £15.2m £1,242.4m £282.7m 22.8%\n\n£1.6m\n\nOrganic +6% +7% +10 bps\n\nReported +8% +7% -20 bps\n\nThe reconciliation for each segment is included in the Strategic Report.\n\n3 Segmental reporting As required by IFRS 8 (Operating Segments), the following segmental information is presented in a consistent format with management information considered by the Board.\n\nFollowing recent material acquisitions into the Group, the composition of the Group’s Reportable Segments changed in the financial year ended 31st December 2019 to align with both how the business is now managed alongside how information is now presented to the Board and the Executive Committee. This change results in Steam Specialties being reported as one single consolidated operating segment. In previous years Steam Specialties was an aggregation of three separate operating segments, EMEA, Americas and Asia Pacific, however recent changes to the management structure resulted in the creation of a separate Steam Specialties management team reporting to the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer on the consolidated Steam Specialties results. Comparative results have not been restated, as the Steam Specialties total was previously disclosed as a subtotal to the three previous geographic operating segments.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of Thermocoax in May 2019, the Chromalox operating segment was renamed to Electric Thermal Solutions which now includes the combination of both businesses in 2019. No other changes to the structure of operating segments have been made.\n\n",

Adjusted EBIT also excludes the share of results in associates and joint ventures. Adjusted earnings per share also excludes certain foreign exchange rate differences, together with related tax effects.\n\nWe believe that it is both useful and necessary to report these measures for the following reasons:\n\n– These measures are used for internal performance reporting;\n\n– These measures are used in setting director and management remuneration; and\n\n– They are useful in connection with discussion with the investment analyst community and debt rating agencies.\n\nAdjusted EBIT is reconciled to the respective closest equivalent GAAP measure, operating profit, in the “Our financial performance” section on page 26. A reconciliation of adjusted operating profit to the respective closest equivalent GAAP measure, operating profit, is provided in note 2 “Revenue disaggregation and segmental analysis” to the consolidated financial statements. A reconciliation of adjusted earnings per share to basic earnings per share is provided in the “Our financial performance” section on page 28.\n\nCash flow measures and capital additions In presenting and discussing our reported results, free cash flow (pre-spectrum), free cash flow, capital additions and operating free cash flow are calculated and presented even though these measures are not recognised within IFRS. We believe that it is both useful and necessary to communicate free cash flow to investors and other interested parties, for the following reasons:\n\n– Free cash flow (pre-spectrum) and free cash flow allows us and external parties to evaluate our liquidity and the cash generated by our\n\noperations. Free cash flow (pre-spectrum) and capital additions do not include payments for licences and spectrum included within intangible assets, items determined independently of the ongoing business, such as the level of dividends, and items which are deemed discretionary, such as cash flows relating to acquisitions and disposals or financing activities. In addition, it does not necessarily reflect the amounts which we have an obligation to incur. However, it does reflect the cash available for such discretionary activities, to strengthen the consolidated statement of financial position or to provide returns to shareholders in the form of dividends or share purchases;\n\n– Free cash flow facilitates comparability of results with other companies, although our measure of free cash flow may not be directly comparable\n\nto similarly titled measures used by other companies;\n\n– These measures are used by management for planning, reporting and incentive purposes; and\n\n– These measures are useful in connection with discussion with the investment analyst community and debt rating agencies.\n\nA reconciliation of cash generated by operations, the closest equivalent GAAP measure, to operating free cash flow and free cash flow, is provided below.\n\nCash generated by operations (refer to note 18) Capital additions Working capital movement in respect of capital additions Disposal of property, plant and equipment Restructuring payments Other Operating free cash flow Taxation Dividends received from associates and investments Dividends paid to non-controlling shareholders in subsidiaries Interest received and paid Free cash flow (pre-spectrum) Licence and spectrum payments Restructuring payments Free cash flow\n\n2019 €m 14,182 (7,227) (89) 45 195 (35) 7,071 (1,040) 498 (584) (502) 5,443 (837) (195) 4,411\n\n2018 €m 13,860 (7,321) 171 41 250 – 7,001 (1,010) 489 (310) (753) 5,417 (1,123) (250) 4,044\n\n"

During 2019, we also sold the first 12 teams for the Call of Duty League, which began its first season in January 2020.\n\nInternational Sales\n\nInternational sales are a fundamental part of our business. An important element of our international strategy is to develop\n\ncontent that is specifically directed toward local cultures and customs. Net revenues from international sales accounted for approximately 54%, 54%, and 55% of our total consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The majority of our net revenues from foreign countries are generated by consumers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business, including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changes in local economies. Accordingly, our future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in local economies.\n\nOperating Metrics\n\nThe following operating metrics are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business. The key drivers of\n\nchanges in our operating metrics are presented in the order of significance.\n\nNet bookings and In-game net bookings\n\nWe monitor net bookings as a key operating metric in evaluating the performance of our business because it enables an analysis of performance based on the timing of actual transactions with our customers and provides more timely indication of trends in our operating results. Net bookings is the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period, and includes license fees, merchandise, and publisher incentives, among others. Net bookings is equal to net revenues excluding the impact from deferrals. In-game net bookings primarily includes the net amount of downloadable content and microtransactions sold during the period, and is equal to in-game net revenues excluding the impact from deferrals.\n\nNet bookings and in-game net bookings were as follows (amounts in millions):\n\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nIncrease (Decrease)\n\nNet bookings\n\n$\n\n6,388\n\n$\n\n7,262\n\n$\n\nIn-game net bookings\n\n$\n\n3,366\n\n$\n\n4,203\n\n$\n\nNet bookings\n\nThe decrease in net bookings for 2019, as compared to 2018, was primarily due to:\n\n\n\na $572 million decrease in Blizzard net bookings primarily driven by (1) lower net bookings from Hearthstone and (2) overall lower net bookings from World of Warcraft expansion and in-game content sales, primarily due to World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth, which was released in August 2018, with no comparable release in 2019 (although net bookings from subscriptions increased due to the release of World of Warcraft Classic in August 2019);\n\n\n\na $239 million decrease in Activision net bookings primarily driven by (1) lower net bookings from the Destiny franchise (reflecting our sale of the publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie in December 2018) and (2) lower net bookings from Call of Duty franchise catalog titles, partially offset by net bookings from Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled, and Call of Duty: Mobile, which were new releases in March 2019, June 2019, and October 2019, respectively; and\n\n33\n\n33\n\n",
            "performed in early 2019, the results of which were reported to the Audit Committee in March 2019. The key finding from the review was the need to increase the use of data analytics within the function.\n\nExternal auditor Transition of external auditor Deloitte was appointed as intu’s external auditor for the 2019 audit following approval at the 2019 AGM, succeeding PwC. Although it is still early into Deloitte’s tenure as intu’s external auditor, I am pleased that the transition of the external audit process has gone well. The Audit Committee has recommended that Deloitte be reappointed as external auditor at the 2020 AGM.\n\nA key area of focus for the Audit Committee in 2019 was the effective transition of the external audit process from PwC to Deloitte. For this to be achieved, a detailed transition plan was put in place between management and Deloitte with the aim of familiarising Deloitte with intu. In addition to regular communication between the Group finance team and Deloitte, the key areas of the transition plan included:\n\n— site visits to shopping centres to see how the assets are operated as well as meeting with centre management and leasing teams\n\n— meetings with the Group’s third- party valuers to understand the valuation process\n\n— detailed reviews of the Group’s\n\ncash flow, financing and covenant projections\n\nExternal auditor effectiveness The Audit Committee has assessed the effectiveness of the external auditor, Deloitte, in line with the approach set out in the FRC’s Audit Quality Practice Aid tailored to the fact that it is Deloitte’s first year as intu’s external auditor. In carrying out the evaluation for 2019 the Audit Committee has reviewed and challenged with the external auditor:\n\n— the 2019 audit plan presented by\n\nDeloitte, including the risks identified and its audit approach\n\n— the FRC’s audit quality inspection\n\nreview of Deloitte\n\n— the output of the audit, including reports to the Audit Committee and management\n\n— performance of the audit team\n\nNon-audit services On 1 January 2017 the Group implemented the FRC’s Ethical Standard for Auditors which imposes restrictions on certain non-audit services. The FRC’s Revised Ethical Standard will become effective for the Group from 15 March 2020. The majority of non-audit related services are prohibited and others require approval by the Audit Committee. There is a statutory overall fee limit of 70 per cent of the average of audit fees charged in the past three years.\n\nThe Audit Committee has sole authority to approve contracts for non-audit services with the external auditor, subject to observing certain guidelines. In order to ensure that external auditor independence and objectivity is maintained, the Audit Committee considers whether the proposed arrangements will maintain external auditor independence. The external auditor must also satisfy the Company that it is acting independently.\n\nThe table below summarises the fees paid to the external auditor over the last three years (with 2019 being attributable to Deloitte, and 2018 and 2017 attributable to PwC).\n\n— Deloitte shadowing PwC through the 2018 audit and attending the November 2018 and February 2019 Audit Committee meetings\n\n— regular communication between\n\nmanagement, Deloitte and PwC to agree and facilitate the handover process\n\n— Deloitte’s review of PwC’s 2018\n\naudit files\n\n— meetings with senior management across intu to familiarise Deloitte with key business processes\n\nat meetings\n\nThe above was assessed through internal feedback, direct meetings, reviews of internal as well as independent reports.\n\nFollowing this review, the Audit Committee has concluded that Deloitte has been effective in its role as external auditor for the 2019 audit. The Audit Committee will continue to review the effectiveness and independence of the external auditor each year.\n\nAudit Committee effectiveness As part of the Board evaluation process, the effectiveness of the Audit Committee was reviewed and this confirmed that the Committee remained effective at meeting its objectives.\n\nSteve Barber Chairman of the Audit Committee 12 March 2020\n\n2019 £000\n\n2018 £000\n\n2017 £000\n\nAudit fees Non-audit fees Total fees paid to auditor Ratio of non-audit fees to audit fees\n\n1,092 598 1,690 55%\n\n823 281 1,104 34%\n\n789 49 838 6%\n\nintu properties plc Annual report 2019\n\n"

The timing of New Year’s Day boosted sales in H2 by 84 bps and Q3, in particular, also benefitted from more stable weather compared to Q2. Dan Murphy’s focus on ‘discovery’ driven range, service and convenience is also beginning to resonate with customers. BWS maintained its strong trading momentum, with enhancements to localised ranging and tailored Woolworths Rewards offerings. The BWS store network grew to 1,346 stores with 30 net new stores and the new BWS Renewal format successfully extended to key urban standalone stores. BWS’ convenience offering continued to expand, with On Demand delivery now available in 605 stores, supporting double‐digit online sales growth. Jimmy Brings expanded its geographical reach to Brisbane, Gold Coast, Canberra and new suburbs in Sydney and Melbourne. Dan Murphy’s delivered double‐digit Online sales growth with new customer offerings, including the roll out of On Demand delivery to 91 stores and 30‐minute\n\nPick up from all stores. In‐store customer experience was enhanced with the introduction of wine merchants in key stores, to improve team product knowledge and customer discovery, while memberships in My Dan’s loyalty program increased 15% on the prior year. Dan Murphy’s store network grew to 230 with three new store openings in Q4 including the first store to be powered by solar energy. Endeavour Drinks sales per square metre increased by 3.2% (1.4% normalised) with sales growth above net average space growth of 1.7%. Gross margin was 22.9%, 14 bps down on a normalised basis, with trading margin improvements offset by higher freight costs attributable to petrol prices, growth in online delivery and category mix. Normalised CODB as a percentage of sales grew 64 bps, driven by a $21 million impairment charge related to goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the Summergate business in China. Summergate has now transitioned to ExportCo. Excluding Summergate, normalised CODB as a percentage of sales increased by 40 bps due to above‐inflationary cost pressures, as well as targeted investment in key focus areas including customer experience, ranging, data and analytics. Endeavour Drinks EBIT for F19 decreased 8.2% to $474 million. EBIT normalised for the 53rd week and Summergate impairment of $21 million decreased 5.6%.

We deleveraged during the second half of 2019 and remain committed to a target leverage profile consistent with a mid to high single A credit rating within a couple of years.\n\nOn July 9, 2019, we closed the acquisition of Red Hat for cash consideration of $34.8 billion. The transaction was funded through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from debt issuances. In order to reduce this debt and return to target leverage ratios within a couple of years, we suspended our share repurchase program at the time of the Red Hat acquisition closing. In the second half of 2019, we reduced debt levels by $10.1 billion. Refer to note P, “Borrowings,” for additional details of financing this transaction.\n\nThe indenture governing our debt securities and our various credit facilities each contain significant covenants which obligate the company to promptly pay principal and interest, limit the aggregate amount of secured indebtedness and sale and leaseback transactions to 10 percent of IBM’s consolidated net tangible assets, and restrict our ability to merge or consolidate unless certain conditions are met. The credit facilities also include a covenant on our consolidated net interest expense ratio, which cannot be less than 2.20 to 1.0, as well as a cross default provision with respect to other defaulted indebtedness of at least $500 million.\n\nWe are in compliance with all of our significant debt covenants and provide periodic certification to our lenders. The failure to comply with debt covenants could constitute an event of default with respect to our debt to which such provisions apply. If certain events of default were to occur, the principal and interest on the debt to which such event of default applied would become immediately due and payable.\n\nWe do not have “ratings trigger” provisions in our debt covenants or documentation, which would allow the holders to declare an event of default and seek to accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating. Our contractual agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the agreement if IBM’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade. At December 31, 2019, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was $673 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of the company’s outstanding instruments and market conditions. We have no other contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would result in a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity.\n\nIn July 2017, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. Various central bank committees and working groups continue to discuss replacement of benchmark rates, the process for amending existing LIBOR-based contracts, and the potential economic impacts of different alternatives. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred alternative rate for USD LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. We are evaluating the potential impact of the replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, including risk management, internal operational readiness and monitoring the FASB standard-setting process to address financial reporting issues that might arise in connection with transition from LIBOR to a new benchmark rate.\n\nWe prepare our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with applicable accounting standards for cash flow presentation on page 71 and highlight causes and events underlying sources and uses of cash in that format on page 45. For the purpose of running its business, IBM manages, monitors and analyzes cash flows in a different format.\n\nManagement uses free cash flow as a measure to evaluate its operating results, plan share repurchase levels, strategic investments and assess its ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. We define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and net cash from operating activities that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables. Free cash flow guidance is derived using an estimate of profit, working capital and operational cash flows. Since we view Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment which we seek to maximize, it is not considered when formulating guidance for free cash flow. As a result, we do not estimate a GAAP Net Cash from Operations expectation metric.",

This has been primarily driven by our efficiency initiatives delivering strong energy reductions in North America and APAC. There was an increase in energy use in EMEA, driven by the opening of new sites in the UK and Finland, and an increase in energy use at our site in Paris. Gas use also increased in the year by 7 per cent, with all sites seeing similar increases over 2018.\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions Spirent is committed to acting to combat climate change and reporting its progress. Our total Scope 1 and 2 emissions dropped by 6.14 per cent from 2018, and our emissions per $ million of revenue were down by 10.9 per cent. We have reduced our total emissions by 29 per cent since our 2014 baseline.\n\nThe Group responded to the Carbon Disclosure Project in 2019, completing the Climate Change and Supply Chain questionnaires. In 2019 we achieved a Climate Change rating of B (management) (2018 C) and a Supplier Engagement rating of B (management) (2018 B). The average for our sector is C in both categories.\n\nMethodology Reporting on emission sources is required under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors Report) Regulations 2013 and these sources fall within our consolidated financial statements. We have reported on all the emission sources that fall within our consolidated financial statements. We do not have any responsibility for any emission sources that are not included in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe have used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition), along with data gathered to fulfil our requirements under these Regulations, and the most recent emission factors available: UK Government’s GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2019 for the UK, US EPA 2018 eGrid emissions factors for the applicable individual states in the US, and 2018 emissions factors for all other countries were sourced from the International Energy Agency’s 2019 data set.\n\nPerformance against target The Group set a target to reduce carbon emissions by five per cent relative to revenue from 2018 figures. We have achieved this target, having reduced carbon emissions per $million of revenue by 10.9 per cent.\n\nCompliance The Group is not required to comply with stages 1 or 2 of the UK Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (ESOS) Regulations 2014.\n\nProcurement Vendor assessment and auditing Vendors are required to abide by our Code of Conduct which sets out our expectations for environmental management, labour and human rights, health and safety, and business ethics.

This exceeded our target of completing 18 audits in the year. No material issues were identified.\n\nCompliance We comply with the requirements of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act 2010.

As part of our commitment to reduce our Greenhouse Gas (‘GHG’) emissions, we moved to a certified green tariff renewable electricity supply contract for our UK operations from the beginning of the financial year.\n\nThe GHG emissions summary below shows our gross emissions including location-based scope 2 emissions, as well as our net emissions accounting for the market-based scope 2 reporting for our certified green electricity tariff.\n\nThe reduction in emissions is driven by continued progress in energy efficiency, a reduction in emissions associated with refrigerants as we continue to move away from fluorinated gas refrigerants, and the general reduction in UK grid carbon factor as more renewables make up a greater proportion of the fuel mix.\n\nReducing packaging and plastics Packaging and plastic have played a vital role in safe food storage and distribution for decades, but now our approach to their use is changing. We work with our customers to look for the best packaging solutions for all our products, that take into account the environmental impact, while keeping our food fresher for longer. We are committed to working with our customers to reducing our use of single-use plastics and partnering with suppliers to find effective alternatives.\n\nWe support the UK Plastics Pact and are committed to meeting its 2025 targets. We will monitor and reduce the amount of plastics used to transport and consume our products, and we aim to develop a circular system whereby plastic is used less and kept out of the environment. Throughout FY19, we have engaged with all key customers and have plans to remove remaining ‘hard to recycle’ packaging as soon as possible.\n\nOver the last six years, we have made good progress in our water consumption per tonne of product, reducing it by 15% over the period. There was also a significant improvement in FY19, and one of the contributing factors to the improvement was the closure of the Evercreech desserts facility which had a higher water intensity than most sites within the business.\n\nWater consumption per tonne of product – UK manufacturing (m3 per tonne)\n\nIn FY19, we saved 18.7 tonnes of plastic by replacing the black plastic trays in a ready meal range with foil. Activities targeting relatively small pieces of plastic such as ‘windows’ on quiche boxes have also led to significant reductions in plastic use.\n\nWe have recycled 758 tonnes of plastic from our manufacturing and distribution activities in FY19 and have identified opportunities for further improvements in the future.\n\nFY19\n\n5.91\n\nFY18\n\n6.45\n\nPrimary energy consumption per tonne of product – UK manufacturing (kWhp per tonne)\n\nFY19\n\n1,235\n\nFY18\n\n1,299\n\nEmissions are summarised below, all reported as CO2 equivalent (‘CO2e’) Emissions from:\n\nEmissions reported in tonnes CO2e* FY19**\n\nFY18**\n\nFY18***\n\nCombustion of fuel and operation of facilities (Scope 1)\n\n59,495\n\n66,336\n\n75,600\n\nElectricity, heat, steam and cooling purchased for own use (Scope 2)\n\n27,633\n\n32,389\n\n67,754\n\nTotal gross emissions (Scope 1 and 2)\n\n87,128\n\n98,725\n\n143,354\n\nGreen tariff\n\n27,603\n\n0\n\n0\n\nTotal net emissions (Scope 1 and 2)\n\n59,525\n\n98,725\n\n143,354\n\nRatio (KgCO2e per £1 sales revenue)\n\n0.060\n\n0.066\n\n0.056\n\nOur GHG emissions have been calculated using the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, and emissions factors from DEFRA’s\n\nUK government GHG conversion factors for company reporting (where factors have not been provided directly by a supplier).\n\n** UK & Ireland only – comparable with FY19 Group structure. *** Full Group including US business.\n\nAnnual Report and Financial Statements 2019\n\n",
            "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued\n\n2 Alternative performance measures continued Net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) To assess the size of the net debt balance relative to the size of the earnings for the Group, we analyse net debt as a proportion of EBITDA. EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortisation of owned property, plant and equipment, software and development to adjusted operating profit. Net debt excludes IFRS 16 lease liabilities. The net debt to EBITDA ratio is calculated as follows:\n\n2019 £m\n\n2018 £m\n\nAdjusted operating profit Depreciation and amortisation of property, plant and equipment, software and development Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation Net debt Net debt to EBITDA\n\n282.7 34.3 317.0 295.2 0.9\n\n264.9 32.9 297.8 235.8 0.8\n\nThe components of net debt are disclosed in Note 24.\n\nOrganic measures As we are a multi-national group of companies, which trade in a large number of foreign currencies and regularly acquire and sometimes dispose of companies, we also refer to organic performance measures throughout the Annual Report. These strip out the effects of the movement of foreign currency exchange rates and of acquisitions and disposals. The Board believes that this allows users of the accounts to gain a further understanding of how the Group has performed.\n\nExchange translation movements are assessed by re-translating prior period reported values to current period exchange rates. Exchange transaction impacts on operating profit are assessed on the basis of transactions being at constant currency between years.\n\nAny acquisitions and disposals that occurred in either the current period or prior period are excluded from the results of both the prior and current period at current period exchange rates.\n\nThe organic percentage movement is calculated as the organic movement divided by the sum of the prior period and exchange.\n\nThe organic bps change in adjusted operating margin is the difference between the current period margin excluding acquisitions and disposals and the prior period margin at current period exchange rates excluding acquisitions and disposals.\n\nA reconciliation of the movement in revenue and adjusted operating profit compared to the prior period is given below.\n\nRevenue Adjusted operating profit Adjusted operating margin\n\n2018 £1,153.3m £264.9m 23.0%\n\nExchange – (£2.0m)\n\nOrganic £73.9m £18.2m\n\nAcquisitions and disposals\n\n2019 £15.2m £1,242.4m £282.7m 22.8%\n\n£1.6m\n\nOrganic +6% +7% +10 bps\n\nReported +8% +7% -20 bps\n\nThe reconciliation for each segment is included in the Strategic Report.\n\n3 Segmental reporting As required by IFRS 8 (Operating Segments), the following segmental information is presented in a consistent format with management information considered by the Board.\n\nFollowing recent material acquisitions into the Group, the composition of the Group’s Reportable Segments changed in the financial year ended 31st December 2019 to align with both how the business is now managed alongside how information is now presented to the Board and the Executive Committee. This change results in Steam Specialties being reported as one single consolidated operating segment. In previous years Steam Specialties was an aggregation of three separate operating segments, EMEA, Americas and Asia Pacific, however recent changes to the management structure resulted in the creation of a separate Steam Specialties management team reporting to the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer on the consolidated Steam Specialties results. Comparative results have not been restated, as the Steam Specialties total was previously disclosed as a subtotal to the three previous geographic operating segments.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of Thermocoax in May 2019, the Chromalox operating segment was renamed to Electric Thermal Solutions which now includes the combination of both businesses in 2019. No other changes to the structure of operating segments have been made.\n\n"

            "Notes to the financial statements continued\n\n17 Joint operations The Group’s interests in Cribbs Causeway and Manchester Arndale are accounted for as joint operations. The Group holds 50 per cent beneficial interests in the relevant freehold or leasehold of these properties. Each joint arrangement is governed by a Trust Deed giving each party rights to income and obligations for expenses in respect of their beneficial interest in the property. The management of the property is established under the Trust Deed as being undertaken by an entity jointly controlled by the beneficial owners of the property. This entity does not have the right to a share of the income or expenditure from the property, other than the receipt of a management fee. Therefore these interests are accounted for as joint operations. The principal place of business of both joint operations is England.\n\n18 Investment in associates\n\n£m\n\n2019\n\nAt 1 January\n\n65.6\n\nShare of post-tax (loss)/profit of associates\n\n(0.3)\n\nImpairment\n\n(7.4)\n\nForeign exchange movements\n\n(4.2)\n\nAt 31 December\n\n53.7\n\nInvestment in associates comprises a 32.4 per cent holding in the ordinary shares of Prozone Intu Properties Limited (Prozone), a listed Indian shopping centre developer, and a 26.8 per cent direct holding in the ordinary shares of Empire Mall Private Limited (Empire) – Empire also forms part of the Prozone group giving the Group an effective ownership of 38.0 per cent. Both companies are incorporated in India.\n\nThe equity method of accounting is applied to the Group’s investments in Prozone and Empire in line with the requirements of IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. The results for the year to 30 September have been used as 31 December information is not available in time for these financial statements. Those results are adjusted to be in line with the Group’s accounting policies and include the most recent property valuations, determined at 30 September 2019, by independent professionally qualified external valuers in line with the valuation methodology described in note 13.\n\nThe market price per share of Prozone at 31 December 2019 was INR19 (31 December 2018: INR29), valuing the Group’s interest at £9.9 million (31 December 2018: £16.4 million) compared with the Prozone carrying value pre-impairment of £41.5 million (31 December 2018: £45.1 million). As the share price of Prozone is lower than its carrying value, a review of the carrying value of Prozone and the Group’s direct interest in Empire (as it also forms part of the Prozone group) has been undertaken. Underpinning the impairment assessment (where the fair value less costs to sell was considered) were the independent third-party valuations received for the investment and development properties, representing the underlying value of the associate’s net assets. Assumptions were also made for tax and other costs that would be reasonably expected if these assets were to be disposed of. Following this review, an impairment of £7.4 million was recognised.\n\n136 136\n\nintu properties plc Annual report 2019 intu properties plc Annual report 2019\n\n2018\n\n64.8\n\n2.3\n\n–\n\n(1.5)\n\n65.",

Volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was flat in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior-year period. This result reflected merchandising changes and price elasticity-related declines in certain brands, as well as isolated production challenges, partially offset by the continued benefit from momentum and innovation successes in the snacks businesses. Price/ mix was flat compared to the prior year as unfavorable mix, coupled with increases in brand building investments with retailers were offset by the impact of higher pricing. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC, which was completed in October 2017, contributed $41.3 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 results included $115.9 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $156.4 million of net sales related to this divested business.\n\nRefrigerated & Frozen net sales for fiscal 2019 were $2.80 billion, an increase of $51.0 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 1% increase in volume compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales volumes was a result of innovation across multiple brands, which was partially offset by the effects of reduced merchandising spend and the impact of a recall during the fourth quarter. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2018, as continued delivery of top-line accretive innovation in several brands was partially offset by brand building investments with retailers. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business, which was completed in February 2018, contributed $25.7 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition.\n\nInternational net sales for fiscal 2019 were $793.4 million, a decrease of $50.1 million, or 6%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 2% increase in volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, a 4% decrease due to foreign exchange rates, and a 2% increase in price/mix, in each case compared to fiscal 2018. The volume and price/ mix increases for fiscal 2019 were driven by growth in the Canadian snacks and frozen businesses. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $3.7 million to International net sales for fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 included $4.1 million of net sales related to our Del Monte® processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada, which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $48.9 million of net sales related to this divested business. In addition, fiscal 2019 and 2018 results included $17.1 million and $24.5 million, respectively, related to our divested Wesson® oil business.\n\nFoodservice net sales for fiscal 2019 were $934.2 million, a decrease of $120.6 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 14% decrease in volume, excluding divestitures. The decline in volume reflected the continued execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy and the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Price/mix increased 5% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in price/mix for fiscal 2019 reflected favorable product and customer mix, the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing, and the execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy. Fiscal 2019 included $34.2 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $53.4 million of net sales related to this divested business.

The majority of our shell eggs are sold at independently quoted wholesale market prices for shell eggs or formulas related to our costs of production which include the cost of corn and soybean meal. The following table shows our net income (loss), gross profit, net average shell egg selling price, the average Urner Barry wholesale large shell egg prices in the southeast region, and feed cost per dozen produced for each of our three most recent fiscal years.\n\nFiscal Year ended\n\nJune 1, 2019\n\nJune 2, 2018\n\nJune 3, 2017\n\nNet income (loss) attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. - (in thousands) Gross profit (in thousands) Net average shell egg selling price (rounded) Average Urner Barry Spot Egg Market Quotations 1 Feed cost per dozen produced\n\n$\n\n54,229 $ 222,859 1.27 1.23 0.415\n\n125,932 $ 361,046 1.40 1.49 0.394\n\n(74,278) 45,550 1.01 0.85 0.399\n\n1- Average Thursday price for the large market (i.e. generic shell eggs) in the southeastern region\n\nThe shell egg industry has historically been subject to periods of high profitability followed by periods of significant loss. The periods of high profitability have often reflected increased consumer demand relative to supply while the periods of significant loss have often reflected excess supply for the then prevailing consumer demand. Historically, demand for shell eggs increases in line with overall population growth. As reflected above, our operating results fluctuate with changes in the spot egg market quote and feed costs. The net average shell egg selling price is the blended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs, including non-graded shell egg sales, breaking stock and undergrades. In fiscal 2017, our net average selling price and dozens sold decreased over the previous fiscal year primarily due to the oversupply of eggs resulting from the repopulation of the national flock of laying hens to levels exceeding the flock size prior to the avian influenza outbreak in 2015, along with a reduced demand for egg products. In fiscal 2018, strong demand resulted in an increase in our average selling price and dozens sold, and feed costs decreased over prior years. Fiscal 2019 saw an increasing U.S. flock size result in oversupply of eggs, particularly in the last half of the fiscal year. This resulted in decreased gross profit and net income for fiscal 2019.\n\n24\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFiscal Year Ended June 1, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 2, 2018\n\nNET SALES\n\nNet sales for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019 were $1,361.2 million, a decrease of $141.7 million, or 9.4%, from net sales of $1,502.9 million for fiscal 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower selling prices for non-specialty eggs in fiscal 2019 due to the oversupply of eggs, particularly in the last half of the fiscal year, contrasted with fiscal 2018 in which we experienced strong demand resulting in higher prices for non-specialty eggs.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, shell egg sales made up approximately 97% of our net sales. Total dozens sold in fiscal 2019 were 1,038.9 million, an increase of 1.2 million dozen, or 0.1%, compared to 1,037.7 million sold in fiscal 2018 resulting in an increase in net sales of $1.7 million for fiscal 2019 compared with the prior year.\n\nNet average selling price of shell eggs decreased from $1.397 per dozen for fiscal 2018 to $1.265 per dozen for fiscal 2019, a decrease of $0.132 per dozen, or 9.4%, primarily reflecting an abundance of eggs in the market. The decrease in sales price in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2018 resulted in a corresponding decrease in net sales of approximately $137.1 million. Our operating results are significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices, which are outside of our control. Small changes in production or demand levels can have a large effect on shell egg prices.\n\nEgg products accounted for approximately 3% of our net sales. These revenues were $41.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019 compared with $43.5 million for the fiscal 2018.\n\nThe table below represents an analysis of our non-specialty and specialty, as well as co-pack specialty, shell egg sales.

            "performed in early 2019, the results of which were reported to the Audit Committee in March 2019. The key finding from the review was the need to increase the use of data analytics within the function.\n\nExternal auditor Transition of external auditor Deloitte was appointed as intu’s external auditor for the 2019 audit following approval at the 2019 AGM, succeeding PwC. Although it is still early into Deloitte’s tenure as intu’s external auditor, I am pleased that the transition of the external audit process has gone well. The Audit Committee has recommended that Deloitte be reappointed as external auditor at the 2020 AGM.\n\nA key area of focus for the Audit Committee in 2019 was the effective transition of the external audit process from PwC to Deloitte. For this to be achieved, a detailed transition plan was put in place between management and Deloitte with the aim of familiarising Deloitte with intu. In addition to regular communication between the Group finance team and Deloitte, the key areas of the transition plan included:\n\n— site visits to shopping centres to see how the assets are operated as well as meeting with centre management and leasing teams\n\n— meetings with the Group’s third- party valuers to understand the valuation process\n\n— detailed reviews of the Group’s\n\ncash flow, financing and covenant projections\n\nExternal auditor effectiveness The Audit Committee has assessed the effectiveness of the external auditor, Deloitte, in line with the approach set out in the FRC’s Audit Quality Practice Aid tailored to the fact that it is Deloitte’s first year as intu’s external auditor. In carrying out the evaluation for 2019 the Audit Committee has reviewed and challenged with the external auditor:\n\n— the 2019 audit plan presented by\n\nDeloitte, including the risks identified and its audit approach\n\n— the FRC’s audit quality inspection\n\nreview of Deloitte\n\n— the output of the audit, including reports to the Audit Committee and management\n\n— performance of the audit team\n\nNon-audit services On 1 January 2017 the Group implemented the FRC’s Ethical Standard for Auditors which imposes restrictions on certain non-audit services. The FRC’s Revised Ethical Standard will become effective for the Group from 15 March 2020. The majority of non-audit related services are prohibited and others require approval by the Audit Committee. There is a statutory overall fee limit of 70 per cent of the average of audit fees charged in the past three years.\n\nThe Audit Committee has sole authority to approve contracts for non-audit services with the external auditor, subject to observing certain guidelines. In order to ensure that external auditor independence and objectivity is maintained, the Audit Committee considers whether the proposed arrangements will maintain external auditor independence. The external auditor must also satisfy the Company that it is acting independently.\n\nThe table below summarises the fees paid to the external auditor over the last three years (with 2019 being attributable to Deloitte, and 2018 and 2017 attributable to PwC).\n\n— Deloitte shadowing PwC through the 2018 audit and attending the November 2018 and February 2019 Audit Committee meetings\n\n— regular communication between\n\nmanagement, Deloitte and PwC to agree and facilitate the handover process\n\n— Deloitte’s review of PwC’s 2018\n\naudit files\n\n— meetings with senior management across intu to familiarise Deloitte with key business processes\n\nat meetings\n\nThe above was assessed through internal feedback, direct meetings, reviews of internal as well as independent reports.\n\nFollowing this review, the Audit Committee has concluded that Deloitte has been effective in its role as external auditor for the 2019 audit. The Audit Committee will continue to review the effectiveness and independence of the external auditor each year.\n\nAudit Committee effectiveness As part of the Board evaluation process, the effectiveness of the Audit Committee was reviewed and this confirmed that the Committee remained effective at meeting its objectives.\n\nSteve Barber Chairman of the Audit Committee 12 March 2020\n\n2019 £000\n\n2018 £000\n\n2017 £000\n\nAudit fees Non-audit fees Total fees paid to auditor Ratio of non-audit fees to audit fees\n\n1,092 598 1,690 55%\n\n823 281 1,104 34%\n\n789 49 838 6%\n\nintu properties plc Annual report 2019\n\n",

The majority of our shell eggs are sold at independently quoted wholesale market prices for shell eggs or formulas related to our costs of production which include the cost of corn and soybean meal. The following table shows our net income (loss), gross profit, net average shell egg selling price, the average Urner Barry wholesale large shell egg prices in the southeast region, and feed cost per dozen produced for each of our three most recent fiscal years.\n\nFiscal Year ended\n\nJune 1, 2019\n\nJune 2, 2018\n\nJune 3, 2017\n\nNet income (loss) attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. - (in thousands) Gross profit (in thousands) Net average shell egg selling price (rounded) Average Urner Barry Spot Egg Market Quotations 1 Feed cost per dozen produced\n\n$\n\n54,229 $ 222,859 1.27 1.23 0.415\n\n125,932 $ 361,046 1.40 1.49 0.394\n\n(74,278) 45,550 1.01 0.85 0.399\n\n1- Average Thursday price for the large market (i.e. generic shell eggs) in the southeastern region\n\nThe shell egg industry has historically been subject to periods of high profitability followed by periods of significant loss. The periods of high profitability have often reflected increased consumer demand relative to supply while the periods of significant loss have often reflected excess supply for the then prevailing consumer demand. Historically, demand for shell eggs increases in line with overall population growth. As reflected above, our operating results fluctuate with changes in the spot egg market quote and feed costs. The net average shell egg selling price is the blended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs, including non-graded shell egg sales, breaking stock and undergrades. In fiscal 2017, our net average selling price and dozens sold decreased over the previous fiscal year primarily due to the oversupply of eggs resulting from the repopulation of the national flock of laying hens to levels exceeding the flock size prior to the avian influenza outbreak in 2015, along with a reduced demand for egg products. In fiscal 2018, strong demand resulted in an increase in our average selling price and dozens sold, and feed costs decreased over prior years. Fiscal 2019 saw an increasing U.S. flock size result in oversupply of eggs, particularly in the last half of the fiscal year. This resulted in decreased gross profit and net income for fiscal 2019.\n\n24\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFiscal Year Ended June 1, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 2, 2018\n\nNET SALES\n\nNet sales for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019 were $1,361.2 million, a decrease of $141.7 million, or 9.4%, from net sales of $1,502.9 million for fiscal 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower selling prices for non-specialty eggs in fiscal 2019 due to the oversupply of eggs, particularly in the last half of the fiscal year, contrasted with fiscal 2018 in which we experienced strong demand resulting in higher prices for non-specialty eggs.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, shell egg sales made up approximately 97% of our net sales. Total dozens sold in fiscal 2019 were 1,038.9 million, an increase of 1.2 million dozen, or 0.1%, compared to 1,037.7 million sold in fiscal 2018 resulting in an increase in net sales of $1.7 million for fiscal 2019 compared with the prior year.\n\nNet average selling price of shell eggs decreased from $1.397 per dozen for fiscal 2018 to $1.265 per dozen for fiscal 2019, a decrease of $0.132 per dozen, or 9.4%, primarily reflecting an abundance of eggs in the market. The decrease in sales price in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2018 resulted in a corresponding decrease in net sales of approximately $137.1 million. Our operating results are significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices, which are outside of our control. Small changes in production or demand levels can have a large effect on shell egg prices.\n\nEgg products accounted for approximately 3% of our net sales. These revenues were $41.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019 compared with $43.5 million for the fiscal 2018.\n\nThe table below represents an analysis of our non-specialty and specialty, as well as co-pack specialty, shell egg sales.

The majority of our shell eggs are sold at independently quoted wholesale market prices for shell eggs or formulas related to our costs of production which include the cost of corn and soybean meal. The following table shows our net income (loss), gross profit, net average shell egg selling price, the average Urner Barry wholesale large shell egg prices in the southeast region, and feed cost per dozen produced for each of our three most recent fiscal years.\n\nFiscal Year ended\n\nJune 1, 2019\n\nJune 2, 2018\n\nJune 3, 2017\n\nNet income (loss) attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. - (in thousands) Gross profit (in thousands) Net average shell egg selling price (rounded) Average Urner Barry Spot Egg Market Quotations 1 Feed cost per dozen produced\n\n$\n\n54,229 $ 222,859 1.27 1.23 0.415\n\n125,932 $ 361,046 1.40 1.49 0.394\n\n(74,278) 45,550 1.01 0.85 0.399\n\n1- Average Thursday price for the large market (i.e. generic shell eggs) in the southeastern region\n\nThe shell egg industry has historically been subject to periods of high profitability followed by periods of significant loss. The periods of high profitability have often reflected increased consumer demand relative to supply while the periods of significant loss have often reflected excess supply for the then prevailing consumer demand. Historically, demand for shell eggs increases in line with overall population growth. As reflected above, our operating results fluctuate with changes in the spot egg market quote and feed costs. The net average shell egg selling price is the blended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs, including non-graded shell egg sales, breaking stock and undergrades. In fiscal 2017, our net average selling price and dozens sold decreased over the previous fiscal year primarily due to the oversupply of eggs resulting from the repopulation of the national flock of laying hens to levels exceeding the flock size prior to the avian influenza outbreak in 2015, along with a reduced demand for egg products. In fiscal 2018, strong demand resulted in an increase in our average selling price and dozens sold, and feed costs decreased over prior years. Fiscal 2019 saw an increasing U.S. flock size result in oversupply of eggs, particularly in the last half of the fiscal year. This resulted in decreased gross profit and net income for fiscal 2019.\n\n24\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFiscal Year Ended June 1, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 2, 2018\n\nNET SALES\n\nNet sales for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019 were $1,361.2 million, a decrease of $141.7 million, or 9.4%, from net sales of $1,502.9 million for fiscal 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower selling prices for non-specialty eggs in fiscal 2019 due to the oversupply of eggs, particularly in the last half of the fiscal year, contrasted with fiscal 2018 in which we experienced strong demand resulting in higher prices for non-specialty eggs.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, shell egg sales made up approximately 97% of our net sales. Total dozens sold in fiscal 2019 were 1,038.9 million, an increase of 1.2 million dozen, or 0.1%, compared to 1,037.7 million sold in fiscal 2018 resulting in an increase in net sales of $1.7 million for fiscal 2019 compared with the prior year.\n\nNet average selling price of shell eggs decreased from $1.397 per dozen for fiscal 2018 to $1.265 per dozen for fiscal 2019, a decrease of $0.132 per dozen, or 9.4%, primarily reflecting an abundance of eggs in the market. The decrease in sales price in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2018 resulted in a corresponding decrease in net sales of approximately $137.1 million. Our operating results are significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices, which are outside of our control. Small changes in production or demand levels can have a large effect on shell egg prices.\n\nEgg products accounted for approximately 3% of our net sales. These revenues were $41.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019 compared with $43.5 million for the fiscal 2018.\n\nThe table below represents an analysis of our non-specialty and specialty, as well as co-pack specialty, shell egg sales.

In periods where the Company estimates that the cost to grow live birds in inventory to a marketable age and then process and distribute those birds will be lower in the aggregate than the anticipated sales proceeds, the Company values the broiler inventories on hand at cost and accumulates costs as the birds are grown to a marketable age subsequent to the balance sheet date. In periods where the Company estimates that the cost to grow live birds in inventory to a marketable age and then process and distribute those birds will be higher in the aggregate than the anticipated sales proceeds, the Company will make an adjustment to lower the value of live birds in inventory to the net realizable value. The significant judgments that management makes in order to assess the net realizable value of its broiler inventory include estimating future selling prices of finished products and the related cost of sales to complete. The Company recorded a charge of $2.8 million at October 31, 2019 and of $9.6 million at October 31, 2018 to reduce the values of live broiler inventories on hand at those dates from cost to net realizable value.\n\nThe increases in feed, eggs and other, processed poultry and packaging materials inventories are also attributable to an increase in the inventory volume at the Tyler, Texas facility.\n\nThe increase in prepared chicken inventory is attributable to the mix of the different finished products in inventory at October 31, 2019, as compared to October 31, 2018, as well as an increase in production volume at the Company's prepared chicken facility in Flowood, Mississippi. During fiscal 2019, the facility processed approximately 129.1 million pounds of prepared chicken products, as compared to approximately 107.6 million pounds during fiscal 2018. Approximately 1.2 million pounds of that increase was in inventory at October 31, 2019, representing an approximately 12% increase in inventory volume.\n\n",

During 2019, we also sold the first 12 teams for the Call of Duty League, which began its first season in January 2020.\n\nInternational Sales\n\nInternational sales are a fundamental part of our business. An important element of our international strategy is to develop\n\ncontent that is specifically directed toward local cultures and customs. Net revenues from international sales accounted for approximately 54%, 54%, and 55% of our total consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The majority of our net revenues from foreign countries are generated by consumers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business, including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changes in local economies. Accordingly, our future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in local economies.\n\nOperating Metrics\n\nThe following operating metrics are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business. The key drivers of\n\nchanges in our operating metrics are presented in the order of significance.\n\nNet bookings and In-game net bookings\n\nWe monitor net bookings as a key operating metric in evaluating the performance of our business because it enables an analysis of performance based on the timing of actual transactions with our customers and provides more timely indication of trends in our operating results. Net bookings is the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period, and includes license fees, merchandise, and publisher incentives, among others. Net bookings is equal to net revenues excluding the impact from deferrals. In-game net bookings primarily includes the net amount of downloadable content and microtransactions sold during the period, and is equal to in-game net revenues excluding the impact from deferrals.\n\nNet bookings and in-game net bookings were as follows (amounts in millions):\n\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nIncrease (Decrease)\n\nNet bookings\n\n$\n\n6,388\n\n$\n\n7,262\n\n$\n\nIn-game net bookings\n\n$\n\n3,366\n\n$\n\n4,203\n\n$\n\nNet bookings\n\nThe decrease in net bookings for 2019, as compared to 2018, was primarily due to:\n\n\n\na $572 million decrease in Blizzard net bookings primarily driven by (1) lower net bookings from Hearthstone and (2) overall lower net bookings from World of Warcraft expansion and in-game content sales, primarily due to World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth, which was released in August 2018, with no comparable release in 2019 (although net bookings from subscriptions increased due to the release of World of Warcraft Classic in August 2019);\n\n\n\na $239 million decrease in Activision net bookings primarily driven by (1) lower net bookings from the Destiny franchise (reflecting our sale of the publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie in December 2018) and (2) lower net bookings from Call of Duty franchise catalog titles, partially offset by net bookings from Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled, and Call of Duty: Mobile, which were new releases in March 2019, June 2019, and October 2019, respectively; and\n\n33\n\n33\n\n",

Sales increased by 5.0% (3.2% normalised) to $8.7 billion with comparable sales increasing 2.3%. The market remained subdued throughout the year with declining volumes offset by price and mix improvements. Sales growth in H2 improved on H1 in both Dan Murphy’s and BWS, with Endeavour Drinks’ sales increasing by 4.8% (normalised) with comparable sales increasing 4.0%, compared to 0.7% growth in H1. The timing of New Year’s Day boosted sales in H2 by 84 bps and Q3, in particular, also benefitted from more stable weather compared to Q2. Dan Murphy’s focus on ‘discovery’ driven range, service and convenience is also beginning to resonate with customers. BWS maintained its strong trading momentum, with enhancements to localised ranging and tailored Woolworths Rewards offerings. The BWS store network grew to 1,346 stores with 30 net new stores and the new BWS Renewal format successfully extended to key urban standalone stores. BWS’ convenience offering continued to expand, with On Demand delivery now available in 605 stores, supporting double‐digit online sales growth. Jimmy Brings expanded its geographical reach to Brisbane, Gold Coast, Canberra and new suburbs in Sydney and Melbourne. Dan Murphy’s delivered double‐digit Online sales growth with new customer offerings, including the roll out of On Demand delivery to 91 stores and 30‐minute\n\nPick up from all stores. In‐store customer experience was enhanced with the introduction of wine merchants in key stores, to improve team product knowledge and customer discovery, while memberships in My Dan’s loyalty program increased 15% on the prior year. Dan Murphy’s store network grew to 230 with three new store openings in Q4 including the first store to be powered by solar energy. Endeavour Drinks sales per square metre increased by 3.2% (1.4% normalised) with sales growth above net average space growth of 1.7%. Gross margin was 22.9%, 14 bps down on a normalised basis, with trading margin improvements offset by higher freight costs attributable to petrol prices, growth in online delivery and category mix. Normalised CODB as a percentage of sales grew 64 bps, driven by a $21 million impairment charge related to goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the Summergate business in China. Summergate has now transitioned to ExportCo.
