| $ 56,649                    |\n\nAs of September 27, 2019, the aggregate intrinsic value of expected to vest restricted stock units including time-based, performance-based, and market-based units was $56.3 million for fiscal year 2019.The total fair value of restricted stock awards and units vested was$11.7 million, $19.7 million and $51.2 million for the fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.RSUs granted generally vest over a period offour years.\n\nIn addition to RSUs, we also issue PRSUs with specific performance vesting criteria.These PRSUs have both a service and performance-based vesting condition and awards are divided into three equal tranches and vest based on achieving certain adjusted earnings per share growth metrics.The service condition requires participants to be employed on May 15th of the following year once the performance condition has been met.Depending on the actual performance achieved, a participant may earn between 0% to 300% of the targeted shares for each tranche, which is determined based on a straight-line interpolation applied for the achievement between the specified performance ranges.As of September 27, 2019, the performance condition targets for awards with future service conditions had not been met.We granted 1,005,854 PRSUs during fiscal year 2019 and 745,047 were forfeited.The amount of incremental PRSU awards that could ultimately vest if all performance criteria are achieved would be 1,196,337 shares assuming a maximum of 300% of the targeted shares.\n\nWe granted 200,000 market-based RSUs during fiscal year 2019, at a weighted average grant date fair value of$17.65 per share, and a total fair value of $3.5 million.Recipients may earn between0% and 150% of the target number of shares based on the Company's achievement of total shareholder return in comparison to a peer group of companies in the Nasdaq composite index over a period of approximately three years.The fair value of the awards was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation and compensation expense is recognized ratably over the service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards of $3.5 million subject to the market condition.The expected volatility of the Company's common stock was estimated based on the historical average volatility rate over the three-year period.The dividend yield assumption was based on historical and anticipated dividend payouts.The risk-free rate assumption was based on observed interest rates consistent with the three-year measurement period.The assumptions used to value the awards are as follows:"],"1":["equity-based compensation; (4) adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments or receipts that may represent a reduction or increase in cash available to us; and (5) other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces the usefulness of the metric as a comparative measure.Because of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA alongside our other GAAP-based financial performance measures, net loss and our other GAAP financial results.The following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\n|

|\n\nAdjusted Gross Margin .Adjusted gross margin represents gross profit plus amortization of acquired intangibles and stock\n\nbased compensation.Adjusted gross margin is a measure used by management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to generate future operating plans.The exclusion of stock\n\nbased compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period\n\nto\n\nperiod basis.In the near term, we expect these expenses to continue to negatively impact our gross profit.Adjusted gross margin is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.We believe that adjusted gross margin provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.Nevertheless, our use of adjusted gross margin has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP.You should consider adjusted gross margin alongside our other GAAP\n\nbased financial performance measures, gross profit and our other GAAP financial results.The following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin to gross profit, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\n|                                      | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |

used in investing activities decreased by $250.0 million, from $693.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 to $443.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.The decrease is attributable to a decrease of $203.7 million in net cash used in payments for the construction costs of newbuildings and other fixed assets, a net increase of $45.5 million in cash from short-term investments in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period of 2018 and an increase of $0.8 million in cash from interest income.\n\n## Net Cash Provided By Financing Activities\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased by $318.0 million, from $368.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 to $50.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.The decrease is mainly attributable to an increase of $316.0 million in bank loan repayments, a decrease of $208.4 million in proceeds from the GasLog Partners' issuance of preference units, a decrease of $60.4 million in proceeds from the GasLog Partners' common unit offerings, an increase of $46.7 million in payments for NOK bond repurchase at a premium, an increase of $26.6 million in cash used for purchases of treasury shares or common units of GasLog Partners, an increase of $18.5 million in payments of loan issuance costs, an increase of $15.4 million in dividend payments on common and preference shares, an increase of $3.7 million in payments for cross currency swaps' termination, an increase of $2.6 million in payments for lease liabilities, an increase of $0.8 million in payments for equity-related costs and a decrease of $0.5 million in proceeds from stock option exercise, partially offset by an increase of $381.6 million in proceeds from borrowings.\n\n## Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018\n\nThe following table summarizes our net cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years indicated:\n\n|                                                  | Year ended December 31,   | Year ended December 31,   | Year ended December 31,   |

                |\n\n## Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $60.1 million, from $223.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $283.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.The increase was attributable to an increase in total revenues (revenues and net pool allocation) of $103.7 million, partially offset by a decrease of $23.5 million caused by movements in working capital accounts, an increase of $15.3 million in cash paid for interest including the interest paid for finance leases and a net decrease of $4.8 million from the remaining movements.\n\n## Net Cash Used In Investing Activities\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $618.4 million, from $74.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $693.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.The increase is mainly attributable to an increase of $591.5 million in payments for the construction costs of newbuildings and other fixed assets and a net decrease in cash from short-term investments of $43.0 million in 2018 compared to 2017.The above movements were partially offset by $14.0 million in payments made for the investment in Gastrade made in 2017 and an increase of $2.1 million in cash from interest income.","Net cash used in investing activities was $296.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.This was driven by our $135.6 million purchase of long-term investments, $89.1 million cash paid to acquire intellectual property, $44.3 million in capital expenditures including personnelrelated costs associated with development of internal-use software, and $27.9 million net cash paid for our acquisition of Connect First, Inc.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $213.3 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to our $135.6 million purchase of long-term investments, an increase of $70.6 million in cash paid for the acquisition of intangible assets, and higher capital expenditures during 2019.\n\n## Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities\n\nOur primary financing activities have consisted of raising proceeds through the issuance of stock under our stock plans and issuance of our Notes.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was approximately $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily resulting from $15.2 million in proceeds from the issuance of shares in connection with our stock plans, net of taxes paid.This was partially offset by payments of $5.2 million of contingent consideration associated with acquisitions, and repayment of our financing obligation of $0.9 million.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, decreased by $388.2 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to proceeds from our Notes issued in 2018.\n\n## Backlog\n\nWe have generally signed new customers to contracts that vary in length, from month-to-month to multi-year terms for our subscriptions.The timing of invoicing to our customers is a negotiated term and thus varies among our subscription contracts.Payment terms are generally billed either monthly or on an annual basis.At any point in the contract term, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice, which constitute backlog.Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, we do not recognize them as revenues, unearned revenues or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements.Given the variability in our contract length, we believe that backlog is not a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.\n\n## Deferred Revenue\n\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of invoiced fees for our subscriptions, which we recognize as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy.Customers with annual or multi-year contracts may opt for annual invoicing.For these customers, we generally invoice only one annual subscription period in advance.Therefore, our deferred revenue balance does not capture the full contract value of such multi-year contracts.Accordingly, we believe that deferred revenue is not a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize deferred revenue as a key management metric internally.\n\n## Contractual Obligations\n\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                             |
