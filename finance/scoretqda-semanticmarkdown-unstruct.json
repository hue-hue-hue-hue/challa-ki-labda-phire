Net cash provided by operating activities decreased during fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to certain unfavorable cash changes in working capital balances, primarily unfavorable changes associated with income taxes including the first installment payment made pursuant to the transition tax provisions of the Tax Act during fiscal 2019 (see additional discussion of future installment payments pursuant to the Tax Act's transition tax under \"Contractual Obligations\" below). Cash flows from investing activities: The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to our acquisitions, the timing of our purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable debt securities and investments in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our growth. Net cash provided by investing activities was $26.6 billion during fiscal 2019 compared to $5.6 billion of net cash used for investing during fiscal 2018. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2019 was primarily due to an increase in sales and maturities of, and a decrease in purchases of, marketable securities and other investments. Cash flows from financing activities: The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments as well as stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs. Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2019 increased compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to increased stock repurchases as we used $36.1 billion of cash to repurchase common stock during fiscal 2019 compared to $11.3 billion during fiscal 2018.","Cash provided by operating activities was $115.5 million in 2019, compared to $90.3 million in 2018. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to improved profitability, improved collections, and other working capital changes in 2019 when compared to 2018."],"26":["|                                                     | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | |-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------| |                                                     | 2019                      | 2018                      | 2017                      | | Net cash provided by operating activities           | $ 115,549                 | $ 90,253                  | $ 67,510                  | | Net cash used in investing activities               | (97,727)                  | (20,876)                  | (36,666)                  | | Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities | 14,775                    | (278,016 )                | 276,852                   |","|                                                                       | Year Ended      | Year Ended        | Year Ended        | |-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------| |                                                                       | January 3, 2020 | December 28, 2018 | December 29, 2017 | |                                                                       | (in millions)   | (in millions)     | (in millions)     | | Net cash provided by operating activities                             | $ 992           | $ 768             | $ 526             | | Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities                   | 65              | (114)             | (71)              | | Net cash used in financing activities                                 | (709)           | (707)             | (429)             | | Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash | $ 348           | $ (53)            | $ 26              |","|                                                      | Year Ended May 31,   | Year Ended May 31,   | Year Ended May 31,   | |------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------| | (Dollars in millions)                                | 2019                 | Change               | 2018                 | | Net cash provided by operating activities            | $ 14,551             | -5%                  | $ 15,386             | | Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities | $ 26,557             | 572%                 | $ (5,625 )           | | Net cash used for financing activities               | $ (42,056 )          | 321%                 | $ (9,982 )           |"],"27":["|                                                     | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | |-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------| |                                                     | 2019                      | 2018                      | 2017                      | | Net cash provided by operating activities           | $ 115,549                 | $ 90,253                  | $ 67,510                  | | Net cash used in investing activities               | (97,727)                  | (20,876)                  | (36,666)                  | | Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities | 14,775                    | (278,016 )                | 276,852                   |","\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $618.4 million, from $74.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $693.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.
